The discussion highlights that both representations have their own distinct ways of encoding graph structure: - An **Adjacency List** is presented where each vertex has a list containing other vertices with which it shares edges, ideal for sparse graphs due to its space efficiency when the number of edges is much lower than the square of the number of vertices. It's also advantageous in iterating through neighbors as there isn’t any need for matrix look-up or transposition steps. - An **Adjacency Matrix**, on the other hand, provides a full representation where each cell (i, j) indicates whether an edge exists between vertex i and vertex j; this method is symmetric across its diagonal and takes up more space especially in dense graphs since it requires storing all possible connections regardless of existence.
