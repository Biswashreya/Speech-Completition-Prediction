1.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:21,00:00:34,do not worry about your difficulties in mathematics i can assure you mine are still greater albert einstein let us count is the title of this chapter probably i am confusing you all probably you are wondering this sounds like a kindergarten lesson why are we taught how to count
1.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:34,00:00:57,we of course know how to count so let me ask this question do you really know how to count do we really know how to count counting is not necessarily counting the number of chocolates in the palm of a kid counting is a lot more than that let me illustrate this with a very nice question
10.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:02,00:00:23,what did you just now see you saw that one person could take a picture in precisely one way now that was a very boring case right there is nothing interesting there because you can probably take another picture in a different location that is what going to change the picture
10.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:23,00:00:53,but then imagine two people taking this photo they can take this photo in two different ways right two how about three people lets say a b and c lets see in how many ways they can take the picture so how do we solve this question the question is this there are these three people a b c in how many ways can you arrange
10.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:53,00:01:16,them and take a picture each of these three people right one way would be abc in this order the other way would be a remains in the same place while c and b swap their locations now they are done this is the second option the third one would be and just repeating what we saw in the video because i am interested
10.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:16,00:01:39,right now in coming on with a formula given n people given three people a b c a c b and then lets say b in the first place a and c in the second and third place next again b as it is and a c swapped then finally c here a b here and the last option would be c b a
10.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:39,00:02:00,now my question is have we exhausted all the possibilities probably yes how about you are sure that you have not left out a possibility thats because we went step by step we saw all possible ways in which a in the first place can take pictures b in the first place can take pictures
10.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:00,,c in the first place can take pictures right there is no way we would have left out a possibility here so there are six possibilities as you can see correct perfect now how about doing this for four things a b c and d let us see
100.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:28,now an important note specially for computer science students you can look up this concept called sat problem its called the satisfiability problem its a very important problem in computer science and it is not known to be its known to be not so easy to solve this okay what is the problem
100.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:28,0:57,assume you are given several see we have only being seeing p q and so on lets assume we have several columns here ab c d e f g h and i so that makes it lets include j also columns and i have a complicated boolean expression which involves all these ten variables ab c d e f
100.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:57,1:25,g h i and j now the question is tell me if there is assignment to ab c d e f g h i j which makes the boolean expression becomes so what do i mean by this these are all inputs to my boolean circuit you see is there a input that gives the answer as
100.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:25,1:55,how do i even solve this question what i should do is i should try all possibilities put a equal put b equal c equal d equal you see its a ten digit binary number for every possibility i should check whether it will return or not correct so there are to possibilities because there are to the possible binary numbers
100.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:55,2:20,that are ten digit long for each of these assignments of s or s to ab c d e f g h i j i must check whether my output is or some one assignment might give me correct so i repeat the question is given a long boolean expression with ten variables like this and
100.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:20,2:49,you are asked to find an assignment that makes it you must try all possible s and assignment to these boolean variables and then see which one gives to the is a very big number correct if you think this is not so big assume you had boolean variables boolean variables in your boolean expression
100.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:49,3:08,then you should try to the possibilities now that is actually an astronomical number to the is very huge correct so that is a reason why the sat problem is tough its not so easy to solve this even with super computers you will not be able to do much
100.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:08,3:31,when you have many boolean variables of course i am not getting into the details of this this is not actually part of our discrete math syallubus but its a very motivational introduction to what is called complexity theory which computer science students will be studying later its a good idea to open a thread here so that they can relate to it when they encounter
100.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:31,3:33,it in the other subjects
101.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:40,so look at this particular truthtable do you see these two columns its clear that these two columns are exactly the same think about it what does this signify it simply signifies that look at the columns and the corresponding headers of these columns they are the boolean expressions the fact that for every possible input that you can think of these two boolean expressions
101.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:40,1:00,agree by agree i mean if he is zero he is zero that is one this is one right which means they both are equivalent right so this is what we mean by equivalence of two boolean expressions we say they are logically the same
102.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:24,let us look at this particular example that we have been seeing from a long time p implies q and look at another column which is not p or q what do you have to say about these truthtables these two columns the two tables they are exactly the same which means they both
102.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:24,0:43,are actually logically equivalent by that i mean we can replace p implies q wherever you spot p implies q you can replace it by not p or q and the resulting expression will continue to be the same
103.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:34,i will now write a truthtable for two different boolean expressions the familiar p implies q and another boolean expression not p or q why am i doing this you will get to know in a minutes time so let me look at the truthtables of these two expressions so p and q as and always and then what is p implies q
103.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:34,1:09,we know it is okay we have not p or q here so i will write down not p for my reference not p would be so i should now write down not p or q or is or is or is or is now pause and observe dont you think these two entries are precisely the same
103.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:09,1:37,yes they are okay whenever two columns are precisely the same their corresponding boolean expressions are equivalent what do i mean by equivalent look here is a boolean expression some lets say boolean expression b here is another boolean expression lets say b dash and then entire column is the same which means no matter what input you give for this boolean
103.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:37,2:03,circuit or boolean expression they agree always when they agree always we should say they both are exactly the same they might appear different so my p implies q here and my not p or q here are exactly the same but they appear different such expressions are called equivalent boolean expressions
103.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:03,2:26,here is an interesting question p implies and implied by q and look at this expression p and q or not p and not q let us write the truthtable of both of these expressions p implies and implied by q has the values and lets try writing the truthtable of this which involves writing the truthtable of p
103.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:26,2:47,and q which is this and then the truthtable of not p and not q which is this and or of these two which is this what do you observe i observe that these entries are same as the entries for p implies and implied by q which means these two expressions are equivalent
104.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:34,lets consider another example i would like to look at this boolean expression p and not q or not p and q so what all should i find i should first find p q not p not q and then p and not q and finally not p and q and this will help me determine my given
104.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:34,0:52,boolean expression right thats all we have this is just to be organized you can in fact if you have the right talent you can directly write down the truthtable of p and not q or not p and q i am just being organized and writing everything that it becomes easy for me to compute p
104.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:52,1:29,q not p is not q will be p and not q will be and is and is and is and is so not p and q is not p and q will be and is and is and is and is now it should take an or of p and
104.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:29,1:59,not q and not p and q i should take an or of these two so how do i do that or is or is or is or is do you observe something this looks very familiar to me what is that this is nothing else but your p exclusive or q right p xor q is
104.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:59,2:27,so what do i conclude i conclude that the given expression p and not q or not p and q is logically equivalent to my p exclusive or q right i repeat whenever truthtable agree their corresponding expressions are considered equivalent thats only obvious right
105.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:27,betty bought some butter but the butter was bitter so she bought better butter to make the bitter butter better butter why did i say all this just for fun now what just happened our friend initially said a very complicated tongue twister but ideally speaking that just meant a small one liner
105.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:27,0:49,bitty had bad butter she replaced that by good butter but look at the tongue twister it looks very complicated now here is a lesson for us to buy there are things that are more complicated than what it actually is and we may want to simplify it dont you think we encounter this problem in a real life too
105.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:49,1:12,i at least do as a professor i read a text book or a piece of a research article and i see it is more complicated than what it was supposed to be right thats because we seldom spend time on simplifying things im reminded of a very beautiful quote by blaise pascal which goes like this
105.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:12,1:34,i write long letters because i lack time to make it short what does it mean it means making it short requires a lot of time short is not less time short making a something very long short is quite a exercise so let us take this as a moral and try to apply this in simplifying boolean expressions
105.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:34,1:50,sometimes your boolean expressions they appear very complicated and big but in reality they may not be as complicated as they appear there are in fact very nice ways in which you can simplify a boolean expression lets see how that can be done
106.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:28,look at this statement it is incorrect to not dress well on a dinner date what does it mean i repeat it is incorrect to not dress well on a dinner date do you see it is incorrect incorrect is not correct to not dress well there is a not and a not in two places
106.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:28,0:50,you know what that means it simply means that you must dress well on a dinner date correct but theres a twist and turn that we use here that just play on words but this statement is actually called a double negation right not a statement it is a sentence
106.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:50,0:58,as i told you in our course the word statement has a different connotation this sentence has what is called a double negation we will see more of this with good examples
107.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:31,here goes some interesting examples of what i just said the double negation look at this statement i never said i dont like sweets what do i mean by this if the statement p is i like sweets p complement will be i dont like sweets and the complement of this would be it is not true that i dont like sweets
107.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:31,0:57,correct so it is not true that i dont like sweets implies that i like sweets which is your statement p so complement of a statement and its complement will give you back the statement now this is like straightforward and commonsensical talk to anyone who understands basic language they will say what is so great about it
107.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:57,1:22,right but then this goes by the name double negation not of not is the same ill give you another example there is this very popular way of stating something in a funny way you see i cant not treat my friend badly what do you mean by that i cannot not treat my friend badly
107.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:22,1:38,you see there is a double negation here as well the not not gets cancelled all you are trying to say is that you will treat your friend well lets now look at the truth table of this there is only one variable p which can take the value or
107.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:38,1:56,p complement will simply be complement of is complement of is and the complement of this will be complement of is complement of is you see the entries of p and p double negation is the same and hence p and p double negation are equivalent
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:25,you see what we have seen so far closely observe that we saw different operators like and or xor and things like that right double negation and things like that there is something nice about these operators although they are very easy to understand there are some nice properties that they follow
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:25,0:49,let us look at those properties you see when i say p and q is true this is same as q and p you see correct he is rich and handsome is same as he is handsome and rich correct perfect now p and q q and p we say are equivalent
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:49,1:07,it doesnt matter whether you write p first or q first p and q is same as q and p very soon you will realize what we are doing now look at this p and q and r is same as p and q and r why is that look at this truth table
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:07,1:26,although sounds very obvious its important for you to observe why it is obvious right look at p and of q and r first write the values of q and r and then this particular column you and it with p what are the entries that you get observe this
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:26,1:47,look at the corresponding entries of p and q and r they are the same and hence they are equivalent right okay now what is less obvious is this statement which is p and of q or r now this is not the same as p and q or r
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:47,2:10,its not true just the way we did before this is not true this is something else this will be p and q or p and r okay these are some of the very important and interesting laws they are given some names so that we can refer to them later
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:10,2:41,the first one is called the commutative law which means order doesnt matter second one is the distributive law which means brackets dont matter as long as the operator is the same and finally this is called the distributive law where and distributes over or a word of caution you must observe that if you replace and with or in the commutative
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:41,3:07,law it still holds good same is true with the other two laws as well so note that whatever we are going to say for one operator it holds good for the other operator also and you must validate and verify it now there are more laws called the idempotent law which is this identity law which is
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:07,3:30,this inverse is this domination is this and absorption is this looks like a very complicated slide full of a lot of details but trust me if you look at it at one level deep you will understand that there is nothing in it it is just like stating a daytoday english statement right
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:30,3:51,look at identity it is nothing else but your a is equal to a equivalent correct inverse is like a into by a is that sort of an equivalence right so just go through it these are all very easy and straightforward if you dont understand you can always talk to us over the forum and we will be happy
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:51,4:08,to answer but as of now we have told you the first three laws the rest we are leaving it to you to understand and write the truth tables and validate the equivalence now that the professor has taught all the laws of logic let us now use them one by
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:08,4:37,one and simplify some statements the first one negation of p implies q this can be written as negation of not p or q i hope you know the reason p implies q is equivalent to not p or q and hence i wrote this when i apply de morgans laws i will get it as negation of negation p and negation
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:37,5:02,q its a not not p and by double negation this becomes p again therefore this is p and not q so this is the answer the next one this statement looks very complicated let us simplify it so ill break it into chunks p or q and p or not q and a or for this entire one with
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:02,5:23,q so what i will do is i will apply the distributive law over here and hence we get it as p or q or q and p or negation q or q as and always you must sit with a pen and paper and do it with us sidebyside
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:23,5:44,applying the associative law it becomes p or q or q this was in the bracket earlier now i will put q or q in the bracket by associative law again here it is p or not q or q the associative law again and then what is q or q
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:44,6:07,q or q is q itself therefore this is p or q and not q or q by the inverse or negation law it becomes a true statement either q is true or not q has to be true and when we apply an or operator we get a true statement
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:07,6:25,and then ill denote this by say t just for convenience t is not something very complicated i am just denoting a true statement here as t i am applying the inverse or the negation law here and how did i get q or q or q i applied the idempotent law if you remember
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:25,6:45,so i get it as p or q and p or t now p or t any statement with an or operator with a true statement its always true and hence i will retain this as it is here so i get it as p or q and t now how do i compute this
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:45,7:07,this depends on whether p or q is true or false if p or q is true then we get it as true itself or the other way so it depends on what p or q is therefore p or q is dominating here by the domination law so i get it as p or q and t by the domination law
108.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:07,7:19,now this value depends on what p or q is so by identity law this becomes just p or q so this entire statement is simplified to p or q
109.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:34,look at these two ladies i make this statement both of them are good looking i repeat both of them are good looking when do you think ill be wrong both of them are not good looking not really i will be wrong rather my statement my statement this statement that both of them are good looking will be wrong
109.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:34,0:49,will be false if one of them at least is not good looking right this is what we mean by what is popularly called the de morgans law
11.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:04,00:00:26,so you would have observed something here there are two ways in which you can write a and b but then keep it as it is similarly there are two ways in which you can write b and c you see and two ways in which you can write a and c so the point is whenever
11.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:26,00:00:47,you bring in a new entity lets say c you can think of keeping c in the first place or the second place or the third place when you keep seeing the first place you have options to put your other two letters a and b in the other two places and this you can do in two
11.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:47,00:01:16,ways similarly a b here this you can do in two ways and here this you can do in two ways the point im trying to make is if for two objects a b it takes two ways for three objects it takes three times because you can write c in first or second or third placeholder
11.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:16,00:01:50,three times the times it takes for you to arrange two objects so the answer is the answer for three objects is going to be the answer for two objects times three now you note if we had four objects lets say a b c and d you take d in the first place d in
11.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:50,00:02:11,the second place d in the third place and d in the fourth place and in the remaining three places a b c can appear in how many ways whatever was the answer for three objects right and here again you have one placeholder one here one here and a b c is the possibilities
11.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:11,00:02:37,for this placeholders and this a b c can appear as you can see in six ways six ways here six ways here and six ways here so basically it is four times six ways which in other words let me write that down answer for four objects is going to be answer for
11.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:37,00:03:21,three objects times four which we know answer for three objects was it is into so in general you probably are seeing a pattern thats forming here the answer for objects is answer for objects into five correct so answer for n objects in general is going to be answered for n minus objects times n so for it happened to be into for
11.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:03:21,00:03:45,it turns out to be into answer for which is into into for its going to be times into into into in general for n this is going to be n into n minus into n minus up to into so this is also called n factorial what did we just
11.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:03:45,00:04:19,now observe we observed that ways in which n people can take all possible photographs happens to be n factorial which stands for n into n minus into n minus up to into now this is a very important finding that we have observed and were going to use this
11.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:04:19,,in almost all of the lectures that are forthcoming from this onwards
110.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:23,you would have observed that the example which i gave to explain this law both the ladies are good looking is actually not a statement my choice of this example was simply because it was very easy on your minds it is nice to see the negation of this statement
110.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:23,0:47,okay let us now look at de morgans law a little more closely it says not of p and q is same as not p or not q so you now know that equivalence means the corresponding entries in the truth table should match lets see if this happens or not
110.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:47,1:11,p q p and q not of p and q then i will write not p not q and finally not p or not q as i fill the entries you should be able to do it all by yourself you will observe that the fourth column and the seventh column match exactly
110.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:11,1:37,so is the case with not of p or q being equivalent to not p and not q now look at the truth table here with these seven columns again here the fourth column and the last column does match we verified these two laws these are very important by two laws i mean de morgans law a two different versions
110.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:37,1:59,you can now connect de morgans law to set theory complement actually is equivalent to negation union here is equivalent to or and intersection is equivalent to and so you see some sort of a similarity between the de morgans law of set theory and the de morgans law of logic
110.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:59,2:06,now that we have studied these laws let us see the laws in action in the coming lectures
111.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:39,so theres a theft scene and our detective sherlock holmes is investigating on the case and he observes that there is this theft but there is no clue whatsoever and then he gets to know that for sure there has been some sort of a burglary but he gets to know that that dog did not bark in that particular
111.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:39,1:12,house where burglary happened dog did not bark in fact the statement is there is absolutely no clue what happened even the dog did not bark is what someone tells sherlock holmes and sherlock holmes immediately reduces there is this burglary that happened and dog did not bark which means the conclusion is that someone inside the house probably is involved that
111.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:12,1:22,the dog recognized the person and hence did not bark and thats the climax of the story and he finally solves the crime mystery so what just happened think about it
112.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:27,when you are given a puzzle you have some information in your hand we have to deduce something and conclude something so similarly even in logic sometimes we will be given statements which are known to be true we have to use that information and arrive at our conclusions following are a few points that you need to make note of
112.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:27,0:49,whatever statements are given to be true we write them one below the other after all the given information is over we put a horizontal line and we write conclusion just below it whenever we come across some primitive statement to be true we write a on top of it
112.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:49,1:09,if it is false we write on top of it you will get to know as we proceed as you know if some primitive statement p is false not p will be true so while writing down the information we write it as p bar is true dont worry much about it
112.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:09,1:29,we will see a lot of problems and you will get a hang of it very soon look at this example given that p is not true and given that p or q is true by this we mean p is known to be false but p or q is known to be true
112.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:29,1:49,this should simply mean that look this fellow is false p is false and i say this or of p and q is true which should imply to you that q is true right i say therefore q is true right i am inferring some fact from the given statements
112.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:49,2:11,look at this i tell you that look there are these two students ram and michael amongst ram and michael at least one of them is intelligent i say this and you also trust me it is true that one of these two at least one of these two are intelligent
112.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:11,2:31,what does that mean that means that ram is intelligent and michael is not or michael is intelligent and ram is not or both of them are intelligent how can you consider both of them because look at the statement what i said above i said at least one of them is intelligent which means both of them can be intelligent
112.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:31,2:51,okay now i say this and then what you do is you interview michael you talk to him you find him very dumb right he doesnt know some of the basics of computer science but he claims he knows he is a graduate in computer science now what can you conclude
112.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:51,3:16,i have told you that its true that one of them at least is intelligent and knows good amount of computer science and you interview michael and you conclude that he doesnt know anything what is your inference now your inference should be ram certainly is intelligent correct now this is precisely what we solved before
112.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:16,3:37,i told you that p or q is true p is ram is intelligent q is michael is intelligent and then you saw that not q was true michael was not intelligent and therefore you concluded that p is true okay now this is just a there is a small difference
112.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:37,3:55,p and q roles are interchanged here from the previous problem but it is same as you can see right p or q is true q is not true therefore p must be true now do you see the importance of deducing something like this you might be wondering such a straightforward english statement why are we complicating
112.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:55,4:16,by using some sophisticated mathematical logic you will observe there were only two statements here what if you had such statements and you were forced to conclude something we will see more such examples where you will feel the need to write things down and then conclude something instead of using plain english logic
113.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:26,look at the statement p i stay in the state called punjab in the country india and we have this beautiful city right next to our institute iit the name of the city is chandigarh it is a very beautiful city now look at this i made this statement p it
113.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:26,0:58,is raining in chandigarh when is p true p is true if it is actually raining right now okay q is the weather in chandigarh is very good today what is p p is it is raining in chandigarh today q is weather is very pleasant in chandigarh today now i say p implies q is true what do i mean by that i mean that if it is raining
113.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:58,1:13,in chandigarh today it implies that weather is going to be nice today its going to be pleasant today this is true right you should not debate on how do you know if this is right right i am telling you its always true in chandigarh that whenever it rains
113.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:13,1:41,the weather becomes really pleasant and awesome now p implies q and it did rain today p is true what can you conclude therefore you can say q is true the weather is indeed pleasant today now let us dissect this more on some given day you go and you observe that q is true and we
113.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:41,2:01,all know that p implies q is true q is true means weather is good in chandigarh today and p implies q means when it rains in chandigarh the weather becomes pleasant in chandigarh q p implies q can you conclude that p is true here absolutely not that is because whenever the weather is
113.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:01,2:22,pleasant i never told you that pleasant weather means that day there was rain right i never said that i only said if it rains on a given day on a particular day that day the weather becomes very pleasant correct so this is false if q is true p implies q is true therefore
113.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:22,2:42,p we cannot conclude but if p is true p implies q is true therefore q we can conclude not just in this case in any case for that matter okay i just revisited this problem although i solved it before this is a good application of this problem and we will see more of such inference
113.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:42,3:09,techniques in the forthcoming questions let us look at this question i will from now onwards not worry much about the english statements i will simply write the mathematical logical statements it is given that statement p statement q and statement r these three statements are given and you are told that p or q is true you are also told that not p or r is
113.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:09,3:35,true you might be wondering what am i doing treat this more like a mathematical puzzle okay and not r is true meaning r is false r is false not p or r is true when r is false right this particular r becomes false and i say not p or r is true when this is false and this entire
113.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:35,3:59,r thing is true not p should be true which means p should be false so p is false here but p or q is true when p is false p or q is true absolutely one can conclude that without any question or doubt q should be true observe this problem carefully if you
113.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:59,4:10,didnt understand think about it watch this video once again all that we did was every single line of this is true what can you say we can say that q is true
114.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:27,a word of warning there could be questions where you cannot conclude anything for example look at this i said p or q is true and i also say q or r is true what can you say you cannot say anything decisively about any variable here okay i will give you one more extra information
114.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:27,0:44,p is given to be true p is given to be true p or q is true q or r is true still you cannot conclude anything about lets say p is given to be true writing therefore p here is redundant you see we already know p is true
114.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:44,1:00,correct can you conclude q is true here can you conclude r is true here not really you cannot i gave you an example where you cannot conclude that something is true im now giving you an example where you can conclude that a lot of things are true as
114.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:00,1:19,well you see look at this p and q is true q implies r is true what can you conclude i am saying p and q is true which means p is true and q is true so p is true q is true and q is implying r which means r is true
114.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:19,1:47,you see therefore you can say that r is true here correct what if i added one more implication here i said p and q is true q implies r and r implies s so given that p and q is true definitely q is true okay q implying r is true which means when q is true q implies r is true which means r should
114.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:47,2:05,be true r is true i can say therefore r also r is implying s r is true which implies s is true i can even say therefore s you saw an example where you could conclude that something is true you saw an example where you couldnt conclude that anything is true
114.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:05,2:09,now we are seeing an example where you could conclude multiple things are true
115.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:28,look at this question p implies q r implies not q and then r is given to be true what can you conclude from these three statements well observe tp r is given to be true all right which means r is true let me write on top of r to denote that r is true once r is true r is implying something that something
115.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:28,0:51,has to be true if the implication is true you see so not q is true which means not q is true means what q is false so when q not q becomes q becomes if q is and p is implying q p cannot be because cannot imply so p has to be so i can say therefore
115.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:51,1:10,p is false or in other words not p is true im sure youre trying to get a hang of this problem if you are not still do not worry we are going to solve more problems you will soon get the hang of it a trick in understanding some of the mathematical questions is to see
115.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:10,1:32,the exercise problem repeatedly okay is to see the same problem again and again do not be in this temptation to solve more problems without understanding the first problem the idea is to understand the first problem properly and repeatedly observe it solve it again and again see the internals of it and then go ahead to the next problem and solve more problems
115.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:32,2:03,it is given that p and q is true and p implies r and q is true r implies s or t is true and s is known to be not true in other words not s is true what can you conclude lets see so p and q is a nice way to say that p is true and q is true okay given that p is true
115.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:03,2:19,let me write on top of p p is true p is implying something this something has to be true when p is true this entire thing is true when the entire thing is true and the entire thing is and of several variables then individually these variables must be to true
115.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:19,2:35,isnt it only if this is and this is can the and of two things be so r is true q is true so let me write that down r is and then q is not q q of course was true here you see p and q both were true now r is true r is implying something
115.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:35,2:57,which means this something should be true so which means s is true or t is true i dont know which one is true but then i have some information sitting here do you see not s means s is not true so put s equal which makes this which forces that t must be true why s or t is true
115.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:57,3:24,s is false and hence t must be true therefore t is how we write the answer right i say that p is true i also say that p is implying q is true i also say that p implies q implies r is true here is a typical example of where thinking englishwise languagewise can
115.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:24,3:41,become complicated you have a nested implication here p is implying some other implication now lets see what we can conclude from this it is so nontrivial at least i am now stumped i have no clue how to proceed with this problem at the first look of it let me go slowly
115.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:41,4:06,p is given to be true let me write on top of p p is implying q so p is given to be true p implies q is true which means q has to be true i put on top of q so i repeat the way we are arguing is always this whenever an implication is given to be true
115.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:06,4:24,here the question is these three statements are true these three logical statements are true okay these three boolean expressions are true p is given to be true p implies q is true we cannot question what if p implies q is false that can never happen that is given to you
115.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:24,4:42,everything above this horizontal line is given to you p is true p implies q is true when p is true and p implies q is true q should be true is all that i am saying thats all is a point in all these problems okay fine lets go ahead so p was true q was given to be we inferred
115.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:42,5:03,that q should be true if p is true and p implies q now p is implying something p is true so this something has to be true this something has to be true and q is see if q is and you say something has to be true r can be or right implies is true implies is true
115.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:03,5:18,but given that q is and q implies r is we know for sure that r is indeed so i say therefore r is which means therefore r is true and this is my inference
116.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:36,let statement p denote raj does yoga regularly and statement q denote rajs blood pressure is normal right now dont you think p implies q is true we are revisiting p implies q if you remember p implies q meant it will not so happen that whenever p is q happens
116.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:36,1:06,to be this is never possible right when p is q is also then you say the implication is always true correct i repeat look at the truth table of p q and p implies q is is is is the only situation where it is false is when p is and q is
116.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:06,1:30,then p implies q becomes false the statement becomes false you see now is this statement true p implies q here very true because you observe logically speaking if you are physically active your blood pressure remains normal okay most of the cases let us assume this to be true always right
116.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:30,1:52,p implies q is true now look at this but does raj do yoga regularly if p is not true if p is false you cannot say anything about q but if p is true you know for sure q is true because p implies q is true now look at this
116.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:52,2:19,if p is true given that p is true and if p implies q is true you can conclude that therefore q is true observe this boxed stuff deeply this is not in particular about the given example in general whenever you say p implies q is true and p is given to be true you forcefully
116.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:19,2:39,should conclude that q is true now it may take some time for this idea to sink into your mind as and always you should solve a lot of problems dont worry if you dont understand what i am saying what im saying might even sound ambiguous but let us solve some to problems and
116.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:39,3:01,at the end of these problems it will be very clear to you what we are doing okay we have solved questions with implication being our final inference now we will try to show this question with four statements and one final inference which is therefore r or s we have to show that r or s is true
116.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:01,3:18,now the same old trick we will try to show this by contradiction what do we do well assume r or s is not true which means r is false s is false the moment you say r is false i am going to spot all rs and make them
116.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:18,3:49,you have one in the second line one in the third line and then s is also so i put s as one in the second line and one in the first line okay perfect now you see that look at the first line s is false first line says not p or s is true which means not p should be true which means p
116.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:49,4:13,is false okay so p should be false everywhere you see p is false fine i make p as false in the fourth line as you saw right okay so p is false and now r is given to be false not q or r is true so q has to be false
116.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:13,4:34,so i put q to be false and i put q to be false in the fourth line as well okay now look at the second line s is false r is false s and r becomes false and not t or this second line not t or s and r is true right
116.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:34,4:49,but s and r is turning out to be false so not t should be true and hence t is false so t is false look at the last line we have a contradiction p is false q is false t is false but you are saying p or q or t is true
116.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:49,5:10,thats not possible so contradiction to our assumption that r or s is false which means r or s should be true and therefore r or s is our answer i am sure you people are getting a hang of it right now look at this question i got to show that t is true
116.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:10,5:30,it is slightly tricky how do i go about it now look at the first line it says not p and q is true which means q is and p is only then will not p be true and not p and q be true okay so p is look at the second line
116.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:30,5:49,p is zero something which is true cannot imply r implies p is true so r has to be only if r becomes cannot imply which is p p is known to be you see so r implies p i very well infer that r is here so far so good
116.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:49,6:09,if r is and not r becomes the next line correct if not r is and this is implying something that something should also be so s is perfect s is s implies t so t has to be so i can conclude that therefore t is true
117.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:25,look at this we saw a lot of questions but let me ask you the simplest of all questions p implies q is given to be true q implies r is given to be true what can i conclude i say therefore p implies r is true now how do i prove this
117.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:25,0:50,i can prove it by the following p implies r becomes false when p is and r is let me force this here when p is q becomes obviously q becomes means r becomes you cannot have r to be and therefore p implies r is true given these two statements
117.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:50,1:13,okay so now this is called the law of syllogism something as basic as this has a name and you are supposed to remember this if you are part of some discrete math examination you should you are supposed to know this particular law if you are asked to state it you may have to state it
117.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:13,1:32,all right although i am not a big fan of memorizing the name of the laws and remembering what they exactly mean but you may have to be warned that some universities might have this expectation from you anyways there are many such laws very pretty straightforward ones and here we are flashing
117.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:32,1:50,all of them as you can see most of them are quite straightforward if you look at modus ponens also called the rule of detachment it simply says p is true p implies q is true therefore q is true you see we have seen a lot of questions this looks like the simplest of all
117.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:50,2:09,anyways there are many such rules roughly a dozen of them and here are here we present all of them to you its left to you to go through them line by line and then understand it prove them and sort of even remember them if it is required but trust me if you are able to understand
117.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:09,2:16,how to solve the rules of inference question you have the wisdom of what makes mathematical logic
118.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:29,well we have now come to the fag end of this chapter which involves basics of mathematical logic let us go back and recollect how we started off with this chapter we proved that square root was irrational how did we prove it we assumed it to be rational and arrived at a contradiction now you are probably wondering in what
118.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:29,0:50,context this was start back then and where did we see its relationship to the chapter now is the time for us to tell you the relationship look at this let the statement s be square root of is rational while we had to prove that square root of is irrational we assume that it
118.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:50,1:11,is rational and call this statement s and s implies some s right we did that square root of we assumed is equal to some p by q and will be equal to p by q and so on and so forth we also assume that p and q are in its simplified form and that it cannot be simplified any further
118.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:11,1:39,so s implies s s implies s and so on we proceed until we conclude something what do we conclude we conclude that p and q is not in its simplest form with the conclusion statement b c right we start with s that square root of is rational and root is equal to p by q in its simplest form and we arrive at a conclusion c
118.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:39,2:03,which says otherwise that p and q is not in its simplest form which is absurdity as you can know s implies c and c is absurd absurd means false it is not true something is not true when s implies false what can you say about s you now have the wisdom to answer this
118.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:03,2:25,question if something implies falsity what is that something that something is also false i am sure you understand implication really well now what was s s was square root of is rational and you are saying that this is not true which means s complement is true if s is square root
118.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:25,2:49,of is rational what is s compliment s compliment stands for square root of is irrational and that is how the proof went what we just now did is we dissected the math behind a mathematical proof isnt that awesome do you see a math hidden in doing math logic
118.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:49,3:01,actually helps you do this its relevance in computer science is in the sense that you can use logic to deduce some conclusions it is a very highly applied subject in modern computing
119.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:29,let us start with an example assume there are two people a and b there are so many ways in which one might know the other person one way is they dont know each other other way second way is a knows b but b doesnt know a second way third way would be b knows a but a doesnt know
119.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:29,0:58,b third way the last way as you would have guessed is a knows b and b knows a you see there are different ways in which a and b can know each other not knowing each other is also a way let us take people a b c d and e these are people they might know each other in
119.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:58,1:24,many different ways one such probable way is a b c d e know each other in a very complex way some people know someone some people doesnt know they dont know someone else and so on this is actually called a relation by a relation we mean given a set of lets say
119.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:24,1:45,people these can be anything a b c d e lets say there could be any kind of relationship between people and one such diagram is called a relation it will be clear to you people very soon but then just concentrate on this fact that given a set s there are many ways
119.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:45,2:14,in which we can define a relation you see everyone knowing everyone else is a relation as you can see here nobody knowing anyone is another relation correct so they are extremes basically situation where nobody knows anyone to situation where everyone knows everyone so here is a basically theres a spectrum of different possible relationships between these two things
119.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:14,2:35,each one of them is called a relation right lets see more of this very soon but all you need to know is given a few people represented by dots and relationship between them basically about who knows who this entire thing comprises of what we call a relation
12.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:04,00:00:48,although the notion of factorial sounds so simple there is something more to it which is not as simple as it appears for example you see factorial is simply factorial is factorial is factorial is factorial factorial is and so on what should surprise you is factorial is actually a big number roughly million
12.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:48,00:01:13,assume what is factorial stands for it stands for people a a up to a taking all possible pictures and lets say they take one second to move around so that they can take a picture with different configuration right if you look at all possibilities if these friends decide to take all possible pictures
12.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:13,00:01:41,by quickly shuffling within a second time they will take seconds which roughly is days roughly a month and a half thats quite some time as you can see so if there are friends they probably should not try taking all possible pictures it probably works for one two and three maybe even four but not beyond that
12.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:41,00:02:18,now what is more surprising is factorial in terms of seconds is approximately years and slightly down this ladder which is factorial seconds is close to the age of the universe which happens to be to the seconds now you see this factorial up to itself is a veryvery huge number such huge numbers are called the astronomical numbers
12.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:18,00:02:46,in computer science we encounter n factorial a whole lot in fact some computation involves factorial number of steps and they are generally considered to be very hard or just not feasible or we say we should not think of computer programs that take factorial number of steps simply because we can never achieve it for even inputs of smaller size
12.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:46,00:03:05,more details of it in the forthcoming chapters but you need to get the wisdom of the fact that factorial of a number when the number is very small appears to be very small but for a sufficiently big number lets say even a for a twodigit number factorial of this
12.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:03:05,00:03:13,twodigit number happens to be tootoo huge that theyre astronomical in size
120.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:40,let us consider the friends a b c d and e let us denote them by dots lets assume a and b were school friends they know each other very well b also knows a very well they were school friends and a and e were lets say college friends and given that a knows b and a also knows e
120.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:40,1:07,a and b being school friends b happens to be a vip he is a very well known personality and hence e also knows b b is very famous so famous that he doesnt know a lot of people but a lot of people know him because of a e is aware of bs presence but b doesnt know e
120.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:07,1:31,there is every possibility right and e lets say knows d because he plays football with d and d also knows e d plays football with c as well so c also knows d given that e knows d and d know c one fine day d introduces e to c and they know each other
120.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:31,1:58,right this can be such a complicated relationship its possible is all i meant right we would like to call such a thing as a relation a relation on the set a b c d e or anything for that matter what i can now do is i can take the population
120.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:58,2:30,of our city lets say a a and a people in a place one lakh people in a place lets say this is a city c i can note the relationship of people here lets say a knows a and a may not know a a might know a and so on you see in this
120.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:30,2:55,i can write down all hundred thousand people and i can understand their relationship with this kind of a graphical structure by graphical structure i mean just by arrows i can record or take a look at or make a note of the kind of relationships that they have with each other
121.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:25,in this example you saw that i told you that set s comprises of five people and there is some sort of relationship between them someone knows someone a knows b and things like that please note this this set need not necessarily be people always and the relationship need
121.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:25,0:53,not necessarily be he knows him the elements of the set s can be anything absolutely anything right so keep your mind open to see examples where the set s will comprise sometimes of numbers sometimes of people sometimes of lets say some abstract quantity so this is just an example that we said a b c d e are people okay
121.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:53,1:10,it can be any abstract quantity we will be giving you more examples which will make it very clear to you that a b c d e can actually be anything and it need not necessarily be five it can even be many in number it will be very clear to you once you start seeing these examples at greater depth
122.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:33,heres a very important concept i told you there are a b c d e five people and some graphical representation on them right i drew arrows between two people showing that a knows b and things like that this is one way of representing a relation there is yet another way which actually is a very important way to represent this relation
122.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:33,1:00,and that way is called the matrix method what do you mean by matrix method it is pretty straightforward you see a b c d e five people some sort of relationship between them i can represent this using ones and zeroes how do i do that assume a knows b then ill write down a b c d e in a column like this and a b
122.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:00,1:23,c d e in a row like this on top of the table this table and then if a knows b i look at as row and bs column then put a there if a doesnt know d ill go to ath row and dth column and put a there
122.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:23,1:52,if lets say c knows d ill go cth row dth column and put a there if c doesnt know e cth row eth column ill put a okay so sometimes see a knows b i have put a in ath row and bth column but b neednt know a so bth row and ath column will have a
122.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:52,2:10,quite easy but is a very important concept in the sense that we will be using it quite often throughout this chapter so we will be giving you more example which will make it very clear but what you all should note is there is this important representation of a relation called a matrix representation
122.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:10,2:34,why the word matrix whatever youve written here is actually a matrix basically i should complete this therell be some more s and s coming here depicting who knows who let me illustrate this with a nice example you see here a knows b and hence ath row and bth column will have a
122.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:34,2:55,b also knows a so bth row and ath column will be a right a knows e so a and e is e knows a so e and a is e knows b but b doesnt know e you see so e knows b so eth row and bth column is
122.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:55,3:21,but bth row and eth column is not note that right c knows e e knows c so cth row eth column is eth row cth column is e and d know each other so let me write that de and ed c d knows each other so cth row
122.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:21,3:52,and dth columns is and dth row and cth column is also so bth row and cth column is actually correct everything else is accurate now please note that in the diagonal weve written s which simply denotes that a person knows himself right so this is just for convenience
122.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:52,4:10,we can maybe write the entire diagonal elements as s or all as s it is based on the context right in this context we are assuming that everyone knows oneself which by the way is something that is true so we write it as s
123.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:30,as i told you these examples may not be always about people and someone knowing someone else it can be any abstract entity ill give you an example which will make it clear that things didnt necessarily be as simple as people and who knows whom lets take for example a set s with some five lines l l l
123.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:30,0:56,l and l here i define a relation between line to line if l is parallel to l so between five of these lines i will define a relation like this whats the relation i put an arrow from l to l if l is parallel to l
124.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:32,lets take a set a of some five elements and then i write down a in two columns as you can see and then i will try to pick all possible twoelement sets from a how do i do that i take something from the left side something from right side how can i do this i can take a and an a a and a b
124.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:32,0:48,a and a c a and a d a and an e or b and an a b and a b b and a c so on and so forth do you see how many possible such two tuples i can take its called the two tuples i can actually
124.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:48,1:07,take into of them this is called the cross product of a set a with itself we denote that by a cross a note this throughout this chapter this notation will be excessively used
125.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:25,see life is all about problems but then one of the tips that counsellors give is try seeing the problem differently every time we see the problem in a different angle it appears different to us and probably one such angle of seeing the problem might help us understand the problem
125.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:25,0:54,better this is very true in math as well generally you will observe that the same thing is seen in different possible ways if you have taken a course in any topic in mathematics you will observe that people will say oh this is the way you define something geometrically this means this right it helps to see what one means by lets say differentiation
125.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:54,1:21,or integration geometrically if you know what one means by differentiation or integration so we spoke about relations i told you one way of seeing what a relation is would be by lets say arrows a b c d e example remember this was the example we represented the relation by arrows another way was via matrix this way correct
125.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:21,1:46,there is a third way and actually the most important way in this chapter that is using simply sets we represent a relation in the form of a set how do we do that observe this very example of a b c d e people instead of writing a knows b i simply write down within
125.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:46,2:08,small brackets ab and so on and so forth i write down all possible relations like this and put that within a set you see whats happening here this is part of your a cross a set that i spoke about rather s cross s in this case because the set is s here
125.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:08,2:33,correct this is a subset of s cross s so you see we observed something any relation is actually a subset of your s cross s correct take any subset of s cross s that will be a relation take any relation it is a subset of s cross s very straightforward
125.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:33,2:37,an idea but it requires some observation from our part to realize whats happening
126.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:30,so points to note people look i defined a relation using three different ways rather different representations right first one was graphical i call it graphical arrows going from one thing to the other second one was simple matrix with s and s the third one as you can see was a set theoretic notation one two and three
126.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:30,0:56,please note this we might toggle between these things when we talk about relations a small key point to keep in mind the first one is a graphical representation it is mainly for our minds to understand whats a relation its easy on our minds although first and second the matrix representation and the graphical representation denote the same relation
126.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:56,1:18,second one is easy on the minds of your computer as you know computers only take matrices and boolean values right it is easy to feed this to the computer right the last one is a set theoretic notation as you can see it again an easy one for a
126.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:18,1:39,computer to read understand and we can ask more questions about such a relation youll understand very soon what i am talking all that you need to know is the matrix representation is easy on the computer the first one the graphical representation is easy on the minds of humans so if you are wondering why state the same thing in three different forms
126.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:39,1:43,as i told you it is just the ease of representation nothing else
127.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:28,youre now familiar with cartesian product and relations let us now see some problems on it consider this set a one two three and b to be a b c and d the question is what is a cross b its a very straightforward question a cross b will have the elements i am going to take one element from a and b and i am
127.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:28,0:50,going to follow this procedure for all the elements of a and b so what will a cross b look like a cross b looks like set of all x comma y where x belongs to a and y belongs to b so a cross b will be comma a comma b comma c comma d comma a comma b
127.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:50,1:10,comma c comma d comma a comma b comma c and comma d so all these are the elements of a cross b please note a cross b is not equal to b cross a you see here comma a belongs to a cross b but a comma does not belong to a cross
127.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:10,1:26,b i am just making a point here that a cross b and b cross a are not same in general so what is going to be the cardinality of a cross b so to find the cardinality of a cross b we use the formula it is equal to cardinality
127.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:26,1:51,of a into cardinality of b cardinality of a happens to be and b happens to be and hence cardinality of a cross b is equal to the next question consider the set s having the elements now i am going to define the relation r on the set s as set of all a b such that a
127.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:51,2:20,b is less than equal to so what are the elements in this relation r so the relation r has elements which satisfied this condition a b is less than or equal to now so it will precisely have comma comma comma comma comma and comma please note comma and comma are not the same as illustrated in the first question
127.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:20,2:26,and hence they are to be returned as two different elements so that is it these are the elements in the relation r
128.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:24,okay a natural question to ask is always especially in discrete mathematics is how many ways right just the way we ask in how many ways can you start from your home and go to your office there may be multiple ways right in discrete math especially this is a very important question
128.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:24,0:47,lets ask the same question with the relations that we explained just now look at the set theoretic notation that we introduced a relation is all possible subsets of a cross a correct if i ask you let the set comprise of five elements okay and then i now will ask you
128.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:47,1:15,how many possible relations are there it is naturally all possible subsets of youre a cross a where a comprises of some five elements lets say right so a cross a comprises of elements and all possible subsets of these elements set is simply to the correct so keep this in your mind well come to this in detail very soon
129.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:33,so formally speaking if we had the set s with not just five elements but lets say in general n elements a to an s cross s will have the following elements from a a a a up to an an and then an an right so youll have total number of elements
129.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:33,0:55,in s cross s will be n square elements our question is what is the total possible subsets of this s cross s so before that we all know that in general when you take a set a comprising of some lets say n elements alpha alpha up to lets not say n
129.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:55,1:19,lets say m elements we know the total number of subsets of this its called the power set if you remember total possible subsets is you basically write all possible sets here all possible subsets of a here the number of elements in this power set will be to the n
129.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:19,1:44,rather m you took m here to the m correct the result is straightforward you can map this to all possible binary numbers of length m there are to the m of them every binary number represents whether you pick an element from the set a or not right we have discussed
129.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:44,2:05,this before its a straightforward observation now the total number of subsets of s cross s will simply be to the power of the number of elements in s cross s which is to the n square why because every possible subset of s cross s is a valid relation and hence there
129.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:05,2:13,are to the n square valid relations and that is the number of total number of relations on s
13.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:01,00:00:24,we are now in a position to learn how to count we will be learning permutations now and we will be solving a variety of problems the knowledge of factorial rule of sum and rule of product will come handy from this point onwards look at these five friends wearing different colored shirts
13.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:24,00:01:27,in how many ways can three people come forward and take a picture you saw what just happened right so there are five friends three of them come forward two of them run away from the scene and these three people take all possible pictures with their locations shifted and which is indeed into into ways
13.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:27,00:01:41,for every such pics from five people you take pictures out of that so in total in how many ways can these five friends take their pictures where every picture contains three of them in all possible coordinates
130.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:26,you see life is full of different types of things you take a vehicle there are different types of vehicles a twowheeler a threewheeler a fourwheeler right even an aeroplane for that matter is a type of vehicle similarly a relation as we define even that comes in different types it is important for
130.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:26,0:41,us to study them by segregating different types of relations first in the sequence is what we call the reflexive relation let me motivate it properly with a nice example
131.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:27,remember in your school days there used to be voting for the leader of the class and my teacher would get into a classroom full of students and say open a chit of paper and write down the names of people whom you would like to vote we were given the liberty of writing many names
131.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:27,0:52,so i would write some four names saying i would want this person as the leader or this person or this person or this person some four names so invariably the teacher would observe that everyone would write down their name first they all wanted to be leaders of the class leaders would get some perks so nobody wanted to miss that opportunity
131.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:52,1:12,but at the same time if everyone only included their names then nobody else will get elected so they would include others name as well so do you see a kind of relation happening here lets not take the example of students lets take only students as you can see the example
131.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:12,1:37,here right ten dots and some sort of voting that people do i vote for some four people this is how it looks like one of them is me for sure so when i vote for myself how does the arrow look like you guessed it right it should be a loop like this right here is a loop
131.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:37,2:07,in this example of the class teacher taking notes from everyone there is a loop on every single person because i told you everybody would vote for themselves invariably and would vote for others as well so here is a relation lets get back to our a x a definition here is a relation which is a subset of our set a x a where a comprises
131.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:07,2:32,of all ten students definitely for sure you observe that self loops are here which means x x is here the first person the same person is here second person second person is here right a a a a a a and so on up to a a is definitely here
131.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:32,3:01,and beyond this there are more elements of a x a such a relation is called a reflexive relation to summarize a relation is a subset of a x a if it contains all possible elements of the form x x for all values of x from the set a we call such a relation a reflexive relation
131.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:01,3:08,well see some examples of what makes a reflexive relation so that it becomes very clear to you
132.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:27,what would be the corresponding matrix representation very easy to observe i leave it to you to think ill just tell you the answer a matrix representation of a relation that is reflexive will have all the diagonal entries as you can see the diagonal entries are all why its obvious
132.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:27,0:29,because of the definition of reflexive relation
133.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:30,so we are going to ask the same question again and again as you know discrete math is all about counting in fact more than of the subject is all about counting so let us again ask a counting question we defined what is a reflexive relation right so let me consider a set s as usual which
133.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:30,0:56,comprises of n elements a a up to an and now i ask the question what are the total number of reflexive relations on s what do i mean by that remember in the previous lecture we saw we asked the question what are the total number of possible relations in general now i am asking the question
133.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:56,1:28,what are the total possible reflexive relations on a set with n elements so let me think how will a relation r look like it is definitely a subset of s cross s but not all subsets of s cross s will be a valid reflexive relation it is that subset which has all the elements a a a a up
133.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:28,1:57,to an an these n elements are definitely going to be there but the rest of the elements the rest of them right rest of them may or may not be there take a pause and then think about what im saying these n elements must and should be there right but the rest of them may or may
133.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:57,2:23,not be there and all possible ways in which you can put the rest of them in quotes rest of them in all possible ways in which you can include this is what makes all possible relations that are reflexive so what is that that is going to be straightforward in s cross s definitely
133.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:23,2:50,you need to include a a a a up to an an the rest of the elements which are n square in number i need to exclude these entities these n elements which is n square minus n and all possible ways in which i can choose the rest of them that i stated here which is going to be
133.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:50,3:14,as and always to the power of n square minus n so the total number of reflexive relations happen to be to the n square minus n again why thats because i need to put these n elements for sure and the rest of them i have to the rest of them choices the rest of them happens
133.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:14,3:21,to be n square minus n and hence the answer for my question happens to be to the n square minus n
134.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:28,remember the example of parallel lines that i gave you let us revisit that example assume you have a set s with five lines l l l l and l i am writing it as a set right now theyre actually lines by a relation r here i mean two lines lets say
134.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:28,0:58,l and l are considered in the relation if l is parallel to l not otherwise so i will have l l written here first entry now its only obvious for us to observe that once l l comes here l l naturally comes there why when this line is parallel to this line so is this
134.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:58,1:24,line parallel to this line its like stating the obvious so l ls presence implies the presence of l l in the relation that i have defined here which is about lines being parallel correct in general whenever you have li lj here you have lj li naturally being present here such a relation
134.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:24,1:52,is called a symmetric relation so what do you mean by symmetric relation whenever you have a b in the relation set b a should belong to the relation set we will see more examples which will help you understand symmetric relations better we will currently take an example where a relation is symmetric and another example where a relation is not symmetric
135.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:31,im sure things are getting easy on your minds let me ask you a question i just now defined what is a symmetric relation can you tell me how does a matrix corresponding to a symmetric relation look like that of lets say parallel lines or any symmetric relation you can think of whats the rule there whats the property of a relation that is symmetric
135.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:31,0:55,whenever a b is there b a should be there correct which means ath row and bth column will have a whenever a b is part of the relation but then if its a symmetric relation b a should also be present which means whenever ath row and bth column has a bth row
135.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:55,1:21,ath column should also have a so what do you mean by ath row bth column and bth row ath column think about it as you can see they are two entries symmetrically across the diagonal of the matrix right so pause and think if required if a relation is symmetric then the
135.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:21,1:50,ijth entry of the matrix and the jith entry of the matrix will both be either s or s correct the matrix will appear like a mirror reflection of what is above the diagonal and what is below the diagonal so formally speaking a relation r is said to be symmetric if whenever a b belongs to r b a also belongs to r
136.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:37,i am now going to give you a cool example of a symmetric relation imagine a hall full of people let me call them a a a up to lets say a i am going to put an arrow from a to a if a shakes his hand with a now please watch whenever a shakes his hand with a it
136.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:37,1:08,is understood that a also shakes his hand with a you see if i consider the relation of who shakes his or her hands with whom that results in a relation correct and such a relation is obviously symmetric why is that thats because as i told you whenever ai and aj shake their
136.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:08,1:29,hands it is understood that the handshake is not just from one person to the other it is a mutual one symmetric relations occur in situations where the relationship is mutual as i told you there are many such relations namely the relationship of lets say he is my cousin
136.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:29,1:51,there is no situation where someone says he is my cousin but i am not his cousin its always mutual in such a situation we call it a symmetric relation and this was an example let me now give you an example of something that is not a symmetric relation and this
136.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:51,2:24,relation example is a very popular one you will see almost all textbooks quoting this example let me consider a few numbers my set test is going to be up to and i say a b belongs to my relation r which as i told you is a subset of s cross s if a divides b i repeat whenever a
136.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:24,2:52,divides b then i say a b belongs to the relation r how does this relation r look like you would have observed that it is obviously reflexive why is that because for every element a a divides a isnt that obvious is it symmetric lets think do you think divides here yes
136.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:52,3:18,thats obvious so belongs to r but do you think belongs to r obviously not so this relation isnt symmetric so here is an example of a relation that is reflexive but not symmetric in general i want to show you if one can come out with an example of something that is not symmetric and here is a good example
137.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:46,let me take an example now of these six lines l l l l l and las you can observe l is parallel to lso which means in the graph l will have a line arrow pointing towards l and l is also parallel to l obviously so there will be a symmetric arrows from l to
137.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:46,1:10,l and l to l so on and so forth the graph will look like this and the corresponding matrix will let me populate the corresponding matrix there will be a this way you can pause the video and maybe check if i am right i have put a lets
137.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:10,1:45,say in l and l lth column and lth column because l is parallel to l so is l with l l is parallel to l you see something very nice about this matrix of course the diagonals have adding to that we observe the matrix is symmetric you see on the right side you
137.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:45,2:06,see below the diagonal on the left side both are exactly the same that is because li lj lj li both have either or that is because two lines are either parallel to each other or they are not parallel to each other anyways another small observation which i made
137.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:06,2:36,just now that whenever a line is parallel to another line let us say here l is parallel to l and l is parallel to something else right l then l will be parallel to l correct this may not be true in real life where a person a is friends with person b and a person b is friends
137.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:36,2:50,with person c person a neednt be friends with person c this is not true in real life with the friendship relation but with parallel lines relation this seems to be true correct
138.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:32,as repetitive as this may soundyes we are emphasizing on the fact that discrete math is all about counting we have been asking this question of how many ways again and again and well ask it once more for symmetric relations so my question is what are the total possible symmetric relations on a set s with five elements in general n elements
139.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:28,what are the total possible symmetric relations given a set s with n elements this is a very little trickier question but the answer is a very nice once you understand it its a little involved you will take some time to understand this so what are the total possible symmetric relations firstly let us write down the given
139.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:28,0:54,symmetric relation and its matrix representation so you have a matrix here and as you know this is called the lower triangle of the matrix and this is called the upper triangle of the matrix and you have the diagonal now let me paint the items in the diagonal and the lower triangle let me
139.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:54,1:19,paint this item blue you see all of them became blue and all the elements above the diagonal the upper triangle i am going to paint it red you will soon see why i am doing this now observe closely any element in the lower diagonal any space in the lower diagonal of this
139.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:19,1:36,matrix if you put one the corresponding symmetric side on the red zone should also be one so you dont have a choice for the red zone once you decide on what is in the blue zone that is lower triangle correct so you have your freedom to put whatever you want in the lower
139.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:36,1:58,triangle and of course you can put whatever you want in the diagonal why what is the diagonal doesnt matter for a symmetric relation all that you need to observe all that you need to ensure is that whatever is below the diagonal symmetrically should be there above the diagonal if its zero here it should be zero there if there is a one here
139.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:58,2:27,it should be a one there correct now i have my freedom to put whatever i want in this blue space holders these blue rectangles basically smallsmall rectangles so in this blue a rather squares in these blue squares i have a right to put anything i want but of course zeros are ones so how many blue squares are there to begin with one plus two
139.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:27,2:53,plus three plus four plus five so on up to n so you have in total n into n plus by number of blue squares and you can put whatever you want here whatever you put here you will get a corresponding values in your red blocks as you can see and itll be a symmetric relation
139.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:53,3:14,or given symmetric relation you can always see that they are symmetric along the diagonal so all that i need to count right now is in how many ways can i write zeros and ones in the blue zone which by the way has n into n plus by number of blue squares
139.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:14,3:39,so the answer simply is to the power of n into n plus by which is to the power n square plus n by n square plus n by in the exponent now why is it to the power of because you can take only a part of this blue zone and call it all ones
139.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:39,4:05,rest are zeros it again boils down to you considering a subset of these blue squares you can consider the subset of these blue squares in to the n square plus n by ways its a little involved maybe you should try watching the video once again or maybe try thinking about it with cross matrix example and it will be very clear to you people
14.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:02,00:00:11,we saw a video where five people lets say a b c d and e these five girls want to come forward and then take a picture but they have a small constraint that the picture should be taken with three friends only which means two persons two people should step back
14.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:11,00:00:55,in how many ways can these five girls take a picture ensuring that the picture comprises of precisely three people now a b c lets say comes forward and as we have seen there are three factorial ways in which they can take a picture and then a b d comes forward and c e steps back
14.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:55,00:01:15,and you have three factorial ways you are probably worried if there are anything overlapping between this and this obviously not in a picture here c is included in a picture here d is included and c is not there although a and b are definitely there here and here
14.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:15,00:01:48,these are obviously different pictures so you have six here and six here abc abd and there are no more options with ab well there is another one which is abe again three factorial ways and you are done you cannot have ab standing in the pictures anymore because you have exhausted all possibilities with a b included
14.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:48,00:02:27,now next what is the immediate next possibility let me think so maybe bc bc and a is already included so i will start with bcd three factorial ways bce three factorial ways with ab we had three possibilities and each possibility had three factorial ways with bc we have only two because we are excluding the possibility with bc including a because it is exhausted already
14.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:27,00:02:58,now ab is done bc is done bc along with d bc along with e exhaust all possibilities now let me move onto lets say ad a and d along with b now thats exhausted here as you can see ad along with lets say c is that over no its not over
14.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:58,00:03:30,so three factorial permutations ad along with b is over ad along with c just got over ad along with e three factorial permutations right and that ends all possibilities with ad how about ae ae with d is over ae with b is over ae with c is not over as you can see
14.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:03:30,00:04:00,so ae with c and ae with thats it ae with d is over ae with c just got over ae with b is over this is three factorial ways done now next let me think of different ways of having this one nice way to exhaust everything is to go in ascending order
14.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:04:00,00:04:45,okay so let me start with c cde three factorial ways correct the last possibility that we are missing here is db and e again three factorial ways as you can see abc abd abe bcd bce adc ade aec cde and deb are all the possible ways in which three people can step forward
14.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:04:45,00:05:12,they are precisely ten in number and each of them can take pictures in six ways so ten of them each of them with six ways is going to be ways what did we just show we showed that number of ways in which five people can decide to take pictures with three in each frame all possible ways is going to be precisely ways
140.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:23,now that we have seen what are reflexive and symmetric relations let us see these concepts in action by solving a few problems consider this set a equal to and let r be a subset of a cross a and i am going to write r as these elements set of all these
140.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:23,0:53,elements nowthe question is r a reflexive relation so a has precisely five elements and in r i see yes r is reflexive because every element of a has an a a belonging to r and hence r is reflexive consider this relation as set of all ab such that ab are natural numbers and b is equal
140.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:53,1:23,to a square so whenever i write ab b will be a square is this relation reflexive so let me just try enumerating r so r will have the elements i will start with the first natural number so square which is and then i go to square is and so on now you see belongs to r is square
140.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:23,1:43,and hence it is there in r but is not equal to because is not square and hence but doesnt belong to r you must be guessing the reason because is not equal to square and hence the reason is the same for all the other natural numbers such as
140.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:43,2:05,and so on we dont have these elements in r and hence this is not a reflexive relation consider the relation on the set of integer r equals to xy such that x square is equal to y square so r will be having all those elements whose squares are equal
140.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:05,2:42,so is this relation reflexive is this relation symmetric so r is going to have all those elements such as you see if you are observing you can see that square is equal to square and so on so these will be the elements of r now for a relation to this symmetric a b
140.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:42,3:17,should be equal to b a is that happening here the squares are and again the squares are so for any element a a it is always equal to a a a and a belong to integers and hence this relation is symmetric consider this relation on natural numbers r equals ab where a and b are natural numbers and a into b is is this relation symmetric
140.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:17,3:49,so what are the elements of this relation we have to pick only natural numbers and hence r is going to have and anything else no it is precisely these elements because we are concentrating only on natural numbers is there is there and all are respectively equal pair wise and hence this is a symmetric relation
141.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:26,youre probably seeing a pattern in the video clips right so we start with a relation a type of relation and then we end up asking the same old question of what are the total possible relations of this type right we basically ask this counting question which i told you is very important right
141.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:26,0:38,so we will continue to have this pattern we will see more different types of relations and then ask the same question of what are the total possible ways in which you can find such a relation
142.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:35,let us take an example consider a hall full of students and the relation there is a b belongs to r if a is taller than b you can observe something nice in this relation which is not always true with all relations and that is whenever a is taller than b and b is taller than
142.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:35,1:01,c then a is taller than c correct by that i mean if a b belongs to r and b c belongs to r then a c belongs to r very easy to observe i repeat a b if its in the relation b c if its in the relation then a c is in the relation if this be the case then you
142.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:01,1:23,call such a relation as a transitive relation you see not every relation is transitive ill try giving you an example of a relation that is not at all transitive i shake my hands with you and you shake your hands with your friend it doesnt mean that i have shaken hands with your
142.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:23,1:48,friend right so a shakes hand with b so a b belongs to r if that be the relation and if b c have shaken hands observe this is a symmetric relation if a b is there then b a is there but then it is in no way transitive because a b and b c doesnt imply a
142.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:48,2:04,c belongs to the relation right so i just now gave you an example of a relation that is not transitive so not all relations are transitive only some relations are transitive can you think of more relations that are transitive
143.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:36,next in the sequence is what when calls an antisymmetric relation sounds a little complicated but let me motivate you all with an example lets get back to the height relation a classroom with people a b belongs to r if a is taller than b correct something is strange about this relation do you observe please note in this classroom no two people
143.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:36,0:59,are of the same height take any two people they are of different heights thats assumed out of people now whenever you take an a and a b you will observe that either a is this fellow is taller than this fellow or this fellow is taller than this fellow i told you there is no two people who are of the same height
143.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:59,1:28,such a relation is called an antisymmetric relation so whats an antisymmetric relation a relation where a b if it is present in the relation then b a cannot be present in the relation so think about it for a minute in a relation there are also elements of the
143.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:28,2:00,type a a correct whats a relation a relation is a subset of a x a correct so there is a possibility for x x to be present a a to be present but then i said when a b is present b a should not be present now when a b is present b a should not be present provided a is not equal to b
143.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:00,2:22,let me summarize an antisymmetric relation is a relation where whenever a b is present then definitely b a is not present unless a is equal to b i am simply stating a very simple definition think about it it will be very clear to you
144.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:27,let us now see some problems on the transitive relation consider a relation on the set of integers as a b such that a b so what are the elements in r these will be the elements so let me tell in general r has the elements a a so all elements are of this type
144.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:27,0:46,now is this a transitive relation this relation is definitely symmetric ill leave it to you to just observe that let me see if it is a transitive relation if a b belongs to r and b c belongs to r we should check if a c belongs to r
144.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:46,1:20,now belongs to r belongs to r but does belong to r definitely no because which is not and hence does not belong to r and hence this relation is not transitive ill now be taking up a slightly nontrivial example consider this relation a b such that sin a sin b the trigonometric function sine
144.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:20,1:42,please concentrate and dont worry you can pause the video and watch it several times so what would be the elements in this relation we have to pick those real numbers a and b such that sin a sin b let me take for simplicity sin is and we know
144.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:42,2:11,that sin is also and hence belongs to r also belongs to r in general any n will belong to r because sin n is but let us see sin is sine is and hence n does not belong to r so let us assume that a b belongs to r b
144.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:11,2:33,c belongs to r so this implies sin a sin b and sin b sin c if sin a sin b it means a b belongs to r and similarly b c belongs to r now by this relation sin a sin c and hence a c belongs to r therefore the relation is transitive
144.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:33,2:48,ill leave it as an exercise to you people to check if this relation is reflexive and symmetric if you remember we have solved some problems so you must be able to do this quickly let us now see a few problems where we can check if the relations are antisymmetric
144.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:48,3:18,consider a relation r on a set of natural numbers r is given to be n n such that n belongs to natural numbers now let me write down the elements in r r is going to have elements such has and so on observe carefully belongs to r but definitely does not belong to
144.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:18,3:45,r because if you consider n as then you cannot have n as it should be here and hence does not belong to r if belongs to r does not belong to r you see if a b belongs to r b a does not belong to r then this relation is said to be antisymmetric here n
144.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:45,4:12,n belongs to r and n n does not belong to r and hence this relation is antisymmetric let me mention something very important here antisymmetric is not the same as not symmetric often these words are confused antisymmetric is thought of as not symmetric but it is not the case in mathematics let us see how ill give you a simple
144.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:12,4:43,example let the set a be equal to and let r be this relation this relation is not symmetric definitely you must be guessing by now because is there but isnt there here but this relation is not antisymmetric as well why and both are there in r and hence its not antisymmetric so antisymmetric is different from not symmetric
145.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:34,now that we saw a couple of examples of antisymmetric relations i am sure it is very clear to you people let me go ahead and make a few observations about antisymmetric relations first observation let me look at the graphical representation of an antisymmetric relation how does it look like so whenever a b is present b a is not present which means a
145.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:34,1:05,b is present means there is an arrow starting from a going to b whenever there is an arrow from one node to another node the other way arrow is strictly missing thats what we mean by an antisymmetric relation however there can be loops you see a a can be present but whenever a b is present b a cannot be present just in case b
145.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:05,1:12,a is present then a b cannot be present this is what we mean by an antisymmetric relation
146.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:34,we saw how does the graphical representation of an antisymmetric relation how does it look like we saw that right now let us see how does the matrix representation look like again its pretty obvious a b is present means ath row bth column will have a b a shouldnt be present means bth row and ath column should be so
146.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:34,0:59,what i mean is whenever an entry below the diagonal is the corresponding entry above the diagonal symmetrically opposite should be if its a here it should be a there if its a there it has to be a here all that i am saying is that you cannot spot a
146.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:59,1:06,and a symmetrically across the diagonal that is what we mean by an antisymmetric relation
147.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:30,you remember right we asked this question what are the total possible symmetric relations on a set s right we even derived an answer for it i am going to derive an answer using a slightly different logic you must be wondering why are we discussing symmetric relations while we were supposed
147.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:30,0:51,to discuss antisymmetric relations these two are related so it is easy for us to see how we solve the symmetric relations question and counted the total number of them with that help we are going to answer the question of how many antisymmetric relations are there on a set s
147.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:51,1:16,so how many symmetric relations are there on a set s lets look at the corresponding matrix of the relation we know if it is symmetric diagonal can be anything right but then whatever you write below the diagonal lets say ijth entry here should be the same as the jith entry here
147.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:16,1:35,if its a here it should be a here if it is a here it should be a here while the diagonal can be anything so now you have your freedom to fill up whatever you want here and things get fixed here based on what you fill here right
147.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:35,1:58,so how many elements are there here you have n elements in total in the matrix and then i remove the diagonal from the matrix which is minus n elements and then take only half of it this part half of it so this will be the number of elements in this zone right
147.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:58,2:18,and i have my freedom to choose whatever i want here correct so i can do it in to the power of n minus n by ways you all know why it is to the power of n minus n by ways correct but then after this i have my freedom to choose whatever i want on the diagonal
147.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:18,2:43,that has nothing to do with your symmetric relation condition right which means i am going to multiply this by to the power of n why thats because for every possibility here you can write whatever you want on the diagonal so this if you remember is the rule of product that we discussed earlier
147.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:43,3:11,so finally this product will be equal to to the power of n minus n by plus n which happens to be to the power of n plus n by and thats the answer that we saw already the logic was slightly different this logic is slightly different given that we are multiplying it by to the n right
147.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:11,3:43,now with this as the logic let us try to extend this logic and try to answer the question as to how many antisymmetric relations one can think of on a set s containing n elements let us ask the question how many antisymmetric relations can one think of on n elements
147.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:43,4:04,correct all right lets see what is the definition of antisymmetric as and always for counting it helps to see the matrix corresponding to the relation right look at the diagonal and then look at the this is actually called the lower triangle this one is called the upper triangle
147.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:04,4:34,i have not been using these jargons but lets use it from now onwards okay here is a lower triangle here is an upper triangle if a relation is antisymmetric whenever you have a in the ijth entry you will have a in the jith entry you cannot have a here unlike your symmetric relation where if you had a here you should
147.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:34,5:03,have a here in antisymmetric if you had a here for sure you will have a here but if you had lets say here you may or may not have here right thats what you mean by antisymmetric by antisymmetric you mean is possible is possible is possible but is impossible
147.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:03,5:35,so is possible is possible is possible but is not possible so for every ijth entry and the jith entry you can fill them up with or or  you have three ways of filling this pair so which means you can put whatever you want in this lowerupper triangle combination but you must ensure that it has to be a
147.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:35,6:09,and only which means you have three possibilities for so many pairs how many pairs n minus n by pairs right how many such pairs are there if you start counting this element and this element as a pair ijth entry and the jith entry as a pair you have n minus n by such pairs
147.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:09,6:32,correct for each of these pairs you can fill them with three possibilities and so these are the total ways in which you can do it but wait a minute your diagonal can be anything correct you can put whatever you want here any combinations of zeros ones or whatever
147.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:32,6:58,you can do that in to the n ways so you got to multiply this huge possibility of to the n minus n by with to the n thus making the answer to be to the n times to the n minus n by and what is this this is the answer for our question how many antisymmetric relations can one think of on
147.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:58,7:02,a set with n elements the answer happens to be this
148.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:28,so i told you discrete math the very origin of this subject was because of the advent of computing it was computer science that led to this whole new branch of mathematics mainly so let us ask a question with computing in mind here is a question weve been discussing
148.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:28,0:50,relations which are sort of you know the set is small set and the possible relation is also obviously small if the set is small but now let us ask a question on a huge relation by huge i mean a big relation with several elements so let me take my set s or a by the way
148.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:50,1:13,s and a i use it interchangeably let me use let me take a set a with elements and then let me consider some relation on a what do i mean by some relation a relation r is a subset of a cross a ill take some relation now this relation is fed into the computer
148.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:13,1:50,how by lets say its corresponding matrix and my computer should tell me whether the given matrix corresponds to a relation which is reflexive or not how do i do that its only obvious that in the matrix representing a reflexive relation the diagonal should all be why thats the definition of reflexive relation for
148.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:50,2:22,every element in the set a that element the same element belongs to the relation this is true for every element containing in a which means i i entry iith entry in the matrix should always be which means the whole diagonal should be however the other entries may or may not be it can be s or s we dont care but the diagonal should all be
148.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:22,2:32,note even if one entry in the diagonal is not it is means the relation is not reflexive
149.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:34,here is a very important notation to note whenever i say a relation matrix representation and another relations matrix representation lets say these two matrices here i say one matrix is less than or equal to the other matrix if for every entry on the left matrix for every entry corresponding entry in the right matrix is greater or equal to
149.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:34,0:53,for example on the left if you have a on the right you must have or if you have on the left side you must then should have on the right side all that we are saying is that the corresponding entries respect the inequality that is put between these two matrices
15.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:05,00:00:25,we asked a question in how many ways can we pick three elements from five elements right three from five theres a notation for this for ease of usage we call it p in how many ways can you bring three elements from five elements right where ordering is important
15.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:25,00:00:51,three friends will stand in different ways each way is considered different from the other right there are three factorial ways with three friends and we enumerated that the ways that we got is basically the representation p this is just a standard one neednt worry much about it but whenever you see a symbol like this in general npr
15.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:51,00:01:03,it means that this is the question of picking r people from n people and these are people taking different photos of them and the total number of ways for this to happen so basically total ways to line up r objects out of n objects and when we line up the
15.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:03,00:01:41,way we line up these objects the order is important if you take five elements three elements lets say abc abc will be different from bac and so on we have discussed that now you saw that p is what exactly do you think is p by that we mean ten people
15.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:41,00:02:09,you pick four people randomly by randomly i mean you try all possible ways in which you can pick four people and these four people should take all possible pictures what are the total possible pictures that you can think of total ways to line up four people out of ten people
15.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:09,00:02:26,let us answer this question so you see there are these ten people lets say a a up to a it might help to imagine them in different colors and you have slots for it and the first slot can have any of these numbers and once you put a fellow here from these people you are left with
15.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:26,00:03:04,choices for the next one and once you put someone here another one here you are left with eight choices for this one and as in always as you can see ten here one less means nine here one less means eight here and one less here means seven so you can put in ten ways a fellow here and you will be left with nine more ways for this
15.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:03:04,00:03:30,eight more ways for this seven more ways for this you may want to pause here think about it now we should take the product of these which is into into into is the number of ways in which we can pick four objects from ten objects and line them up and consider all possible orderings
15.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:03:30,00:04:03,so if its not clear to you you probably should revise the rule of products so this concept isnt very straightforward of course there are easier ways of explaining this but i leave it to you for you to pause and think about what exactly one means by npr it is indeed very difficult for one to get it in the first attempt but as in when we
15.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:04:03,00:04:09,encounter more examples it becomes very clear to you what one means by npr
150.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:34,so notations in action dont you see that a reflexive relation under corresponding matrix m matrix m represents a reflexive relation dont you think this satisfies this inequality where you see the left matrix is all s in the diagonal and s in other places this matrix is actually denoted by i i for identity matrix you would have known
150.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:34,0:53,you would have seen this before so im if this is true then the matrix m denotes a reflexive relation and in case this inequality is not true then matrix m does not represent a reflexive relation think about it
151.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:28,what do we mean by i less than or equal to the matrix by this we mean every entry of i here we know what it is diagonals will be s rest will be s if i say my matrix is less than or equal to this matrix it means that corresponding diagonal elements please
151.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:28,0:51,note you better be familiar what we mean by less than or equal to right without that you cannot understand what i am saying here correct okay so the diagonal here in mr should all be why less than or equal to means the corresponding element should respect that inequality whenever you put here the only thing you
151.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:51,1:16,were allowed to put here so that this less than or equal to is followed is correct so whenever we say i mr diagonals of mr the matrix m lets say instead of mr ill say m the diagonals of mr should be the rest can actually be anything now
151.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:16,1:37,isnt that the definition of reflexive relation but the diagonal should be the rest can be anything you see this is taking care of that whenever i say i mr think about it if you are not following what i am saying you probably should understand the less than or equal to symbols usage
151.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:37,1:41,when we talk about matrices
152.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:33,how do we check whether a given relation is symmetric or not you must look at all possible entries in the matrix and see if the corresponding entries across the diagonal are the same or not basically the red zone and the blue zone the corresponding entries should all be the same so what do i mean by this notationwise all i am saying is the entries
152.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:33,0:43,after considering the transpose of the matrix m should be equal to m transpose isnt it
153.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:25,how does m mt signify that m is symmetric observe symmetric means ijth entry should be equal to jith entry when you take the transpose of m your ijth entry becomes jith entry your jith entry becomes ijth entry and when you say it should be equal you are essentially saying the same thing
153.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:25,0:48,the ijth entry should be equal to jith entry the english statement of ijth entry should be equal to jith entry is captured by this mathematical equation m should be equal to m transpose then m is symmetric if not then m is not symmetric a word of warning not symmetric is different
153.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:48,0:52,from antisymmetric i leave it to you to observe what i just now said
154.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:22,we have been looking at the same question of given a matrix m how do you say if its reflexive or not how do you say if it is symmetric or not now well ask this question how do you say that it is antisymmetric or not what is given to you the matrix m you are supposed to tell me whether
154.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:22,0:55,the matrix corresponds to an antisymmetric relation or not how do you say that so let me now tell you this you figure it out its quite obvious and straightforward so did you figure out all right ill tell you the answer you just verify whether i am right or wrong you can check if the matrix m is antisymmetric
154.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:55,1:03,or not just by checking if m intersection m transpose is less than or equal to i
155.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:32,let us start with a couple of examples first example assume i walk into a town a town full of people let this be my set s i called two people to be related lets say a and b are related a b belongs to r if a and b both are born in the same month assume here is
155.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:32,0:56,a person here is a person and they both were born in november then this this belongs to r a b belongs to r this is one example the second example is assume i go to a school my set s here is going to be a school full of kids any two kids are related a
155.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:56,1:21,b belongs to r s is set of all children in the school a b belongs to r if a and b have the same blood group assume a was of blood group b positive b is also of blood group b positive then a b belongs to r in case they are of different blood groups
155.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:21,1:45,that dont belong to r c d is of different blood groups then they do not belong to r what do you see common in these two examples in fact these two relations are more or less the same how do you observe that both the relations satisfy the three properties
155.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:45,2:04,namely reflexive symmetric and transitive its easy to verify this such a relation is called an equivalence relation so whats an equivalence relation something that satisfies reflexive symmetric and transitive all three put together
156.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:29,we are now going to see a nice example on equivalence relation consider the set s a b where a and b are natural numbers so what is s actually s is simply the cross product of n ie s n x n now ill define a relation on s like
156.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:29,1:11,this r a b c d ad bc observe this relation very carefully the elements here are a b is considered to be one element c d is another element a b c d and this should satisfy ad bc or ab cd the ratio of a and b should be equal to the ratio of c and d pause here and think for a while
156.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:11,1:41,let us check if this relation is an equivalence relation so we have this set r so for the relation r to be reflexive a a must belong to r observe a b a b i take this element this must belong to r correct we are considering a b to be one element and hence
156.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:41,2:10,we have ab ab according to the condition and hence r is a reflexive relation let us take an example this is a this is b this is a and this is b again so a b a b and hence this belongs to r this is true for every a
156.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:10,2:37,b and hence r is a reflexive relation now is r symmetric let us assume a b c d belongs to r a b c d belongs to r this implies ad bc but dont you think it is the same as bc ad think for a moment but what does this imply
156.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:37,3:13,it implies c d a b belongs to r according to our condition and hence r is symmetric let me take an example and hence belongs to r which also implies belongs to r well this must be clear now the last property to check is transitivity if a b c d belongs to r and c d e
156.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:13,3:43,f belongs to r does it imply a b a f belongs to r let us check so if a b c d belongs to r it implies ab cd according to the condition now i am also telling that c d e f belongs to r what does this imply this implies cd ef i hope this step is clear
156.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:43,4:24,now look at these two comparisons this implies ab ef and hence a b e f belongs to the relation hence r is transitive let us take a quick example we know that and and hence so we saw that this relation is reflexive symmetric and transitive and hence and an equivalence relation
156.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:24,4:31,pause the video at each step and make sure that youve understood every step clearly
157.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:26,lets get back to the example of a town full of people where two people are related if they have the same birth month there is something that we observe here any random person you take like say an x belonging to the set s his month of birth happens to be april dont
157.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:26,0:53,you think he is related to everyone who is born in april right so is true with someone else lets say y who was born in november and this chap will be related to everyone born in november let us observe something in this example you see the entire town comprises of people each
157.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:53,1:17,and every person is born in one month or the other let us take everyone who were born in january call them the january cluster lets take everyone born in february and call it the february cluster so on and so forth do you observe something in the january cluster
157.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:17,1:49,every single person born on january is present of that town any two people inside this cluster are related any ab where a and b are from this cluster satisfy this property that ab belongs to r on the contrary if you take two people across clusters they are obviously not related so lets summarize take any two people within
157.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:49,2:09,any of these clusters pick a cluster pick two people from the cluster you will see that they are related pick two people across the clusters they are not related this happens to be a very important observation about equivalence relations in general
158.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:38,let me motivate you all with yet another example so let me consider integers from to i call two numbers to be related if they both leave the same remainder when divided by you see and are related because they both leave the remainder when divided by so likewise i call i take lets say and observe that is related to is related to
158.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:38,0:56,is related to lets say and so on right do you see something very peculiar about this relation it is again classifying the entire set into disjoint partitions
159.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:23,we must note something this is not just true of finite set a this is true in general for any set a i used a finite set with n elements in the previous case in the previous illustration just to make you all understand okay the set a can actually be infinite
159.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:23,0:49,lets seea quick example let us assume the set a is set of all integers lets say set of all nonnegative integers up to lets say infinity you take everything all right and what you do is you say a is related to b if a is congruent to b modulo
159.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:49,1:15,by that we mean a and b leave the same remainder when divided by what just happens here lets observe a is obviously equivalent a is equivalent to a mod okay a is a mod because a and a obviously leave the same remainder when divided by right that is what we mean by three lines like this and b mod means a and b leave the same
159.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:15,1:36,remainder when divided by so it is obviously reflexive because a is related to a for all elements a in a capital a okay and if a is related to b what can you say about b being related to a isnt it obvious a is related to b means a and b leave the same remainder when divided by
159.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:36,1:56,if that be the case dont you think b and a should also leave the same remainder when divided by like what are we even discussing here right so symmetric property follows very easily right now transitivity what is that a is related to b bis related to c it should imply that a is related to c
159.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:56,2:15,is this true when a and b leave the remainder same remainder when divided by and b and c leave the same remainder when its divided by it is only obvious that a and c also leaves the same reminder when divided by let me not explain you see why this is true right
159.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:15,2:40,okay so transitivity also follows so this relation r defined by a is related to b if a and b leave the same remainder when divided by happens to be a reflexive relation symmetric relation and a transitive relation and hence it becomes an equivalence relation but will it induce the partition on a
159.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:40,3:10,yes it does very easy to observe let us write this on inside a big circle you see the whole of this and so on all multiples of as you can see belongs to one cluster lets call it sokay and so on belongs to another cluster lets call it s
159.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:10,3:34,and the next one would be and then and then and then all of this leave as remainder when divided by they all will form a partition s and your swill be and so on this will be your s and ta da as you can see your entire set a which was all nonnegative
159.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:34,3:56,integers can now be written as s unions union s union s so a set of all these integers a relation like that of this where a is related to b if a and b leave the same reminder when divided by or for that matter any number is just
159.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:56,4:15,for example you can even replace by then you will get s s s s and s observe right okay so it induced a partition here is all i am saying right okay and point to note is its an infinite set which means it doesnt hold good just for
159.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:15,4:38,although the proof was for finite sets it is easy to observe that it is true for infinite sets as well as and always why are we studying this many aspects of computing have something to do with these kinds of a relation called the equivalence relation it is important for us to have an understanding that equivalence relation partitions a set
159.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:38,4:56,into disjoint equivalent sets i mean given a set a with n elements you will get s s s up to sk is all i mean such that these things are all mutually disjoint no two sets have an element in common and union of these sets will give you back a
159.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:56,5:08,please remember this if you dont remember the proof its okay you can always get it by a little bit of thought but you must remember that equivalence relation induces a partition of a given set
16.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:04,00:00:16,so a formula for npr in general is going to be you have n objects lets say a a up to an and you have r slots to fill r number of slots and the first slot you can fill you have n choices for the first slot and n minus choices for the second n minus for the third so on and so forth
16.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:16,00:00:53,for the last one you have n minus r plus you want to think why its minus r plus right so it will be the product of these things is going to be n into n minus into n minus up to n minus r plus a little bit of observation says this is nothing else but n factorial in some terms chopped off correct
16.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:53,00:01:00,what is that n factorial divided by what is the immediate next term after this as you can see its decreasing so after nr it will be less starting from here which is n minus r and factorial of that which is being chopped off i can start write that in the denominator
16.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:00,00:01:24,perfect thats the formula for npr
160.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:34,let us now take a look at an interesting result basically i am going to summarize what we have been discussing so far so the theorem statement goes like this given a set s and a relation r on the set s if the relation is an equivalence relation then such a relation partitions the set s into disjoint partitions
160.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:34,0:49,the converse is also true which means you take a set which is partitioned into disjoint subsets there is an equivalence relation in action there we will see more of it over a screen cast
161.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:25,let us consider a group of people roughly people these people are sort of friends with each other by that i mean not everybody is friends with everyone but some people are friends with some people but then friendship is a kind of relation you see a is friends with b right
161.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:25,0:47,and this friendship as you know is a symmetric relation a is friends with b b is also friends with a otherwise you will never say hey he is my friend by that it means he is your friend and you are also his friend correct okay this group of people have a weird kind of friendship
161.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:47,1:18,what is the weirdity here whenever a likes b and b likes c a likes c i repeat when i know someone and that someone knows someone then i know this new someone as well so a knows b b knows c means a should know c whenever i say no it is friendship and
161.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:18,1:45,friendship as you can see is a symmetric relation okay a is related to b and b is related to a now this group of people enjoy this new kind of relationship where a friends friend is always a friend okay let us observe this carefully how does such group of people look like
161.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:45,2:04,let me analyze so a is friends with b b is friends with c and hence a will be friends with c okay i repeat this is a property of this group what is the property a friends friend is a friend that is the main property enjoyed by this group
161.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:04,2:21,now just in case b is friends with d okay a b c are friends with each other and d is friends with b now look at the property of this friends b is friends with d which means a also becomes is supposed to be friends with d b is
161.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:21,2:41,friends with d c is friends with b so c will be a friend of d correct you see when d knows someone in this team of three people d will end up knowing everybody so that the property is satisfied do you get that it takes some time to a for this concept to sync in
161.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:41,3:04,let it take its own time dont worry okay the idea is simple if a group of people enjoy this property that a friends friend is friend something like this happens where if some one person knows some person and the and he ends up knowing the entire team just the way d knew b and that enforces d to know the whole of a b
161.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:04,3:22,c now a b c d are four friends who know each other now lets say e knows c c and e know each other then this cannot happen it cannot so happen that c and e are the only ones who know each other meaning e doesnt know anyone else
161.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:22,3:39,in that case the property is not satisfied so e knows c c knows d so e should know d e knows d d knows b so e should know b similarly e should know a what just happened when you realize that a person knows someone you realize that the person knows everybody
161.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:39,4:09,in the team now patiently observe let a new person f come here he doesnt know lets say d f doesnt know d can f know e no if f knows e then f will be forced to know d but f doesnt know d so f cannot know e in fact a close observation says f cannot know anybody here
161.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:09,4:32,if he doesnt know one person he will not know anybody in that sort of a team the closely knit team where everyone knows everyone else right so these people if you if they enjoy this property that a friends friend is by default a friend then such people will appear something like this
161.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:32,4:54,they would have formed clusters where people within the cluster will know each other and people across clusters will not know each other isnt that obvious you may want to think about it you see not everything can be explained with a pen paper and lets say animation there should be some amount of effort from your side as well
161.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:54,4:57,think about it if you dont understand you can always ask a question
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:29,the example that we just illustrated simply has the following to say mathematically speaking given a set a comprising of some n elements lets say a a up to an we are considering the set is finite and then there is a relation r defined on it and this relation r is known to be reflexive symmetric and transitive okay
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:29,0:53,then what does this relation do to the set what do i even mean by this sentence relation do to the set i mean it sounds like some complicated english usage you know what can a relation do to a set you see its a i mean there is nothing that a relation does to a set you define a relation on a set but by that i
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:53,1:25,mean this relation classifies the set into type type type okay so what do i mean by that you saw the recent example of friendships right okay there is a bunch of friends gets classified into several types or rather what is called partitions you partition these friends into some disjoint sets you see a friend either belongs to the set
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:25,1:51,a smaller cluster and knows everyone there or he is completely outside that clusterokay so lets see mathematically what this means given an equivalence relation r which is known to be reflexive symmetric and transitive let us see what happens to this set you will even realize what i mean by what happens very soon so its reflexive which means for every element
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:51,2:15,that element a r b belongs to the relation correct a is related to b is what i mean right okay i am sorry a is related to a because it is reflexive for any element a a is related to acorrect we have been seeing that quite obvious second symmetric whenever a is related to b b is also related to a right there are
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:15,2:47,many such relationships a is friends with b then b is also friends with a the last one is transitive which means whenever a is related to b and bis related to c a is related to c now let me consider this a here coming from a okay a belongsto a now just in case a and a were related let me write this as a r a
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:47,3:11,then i realize that a r ais also true because the relation is given to be symmetric now assuming a is related to a itimplies that a is related to a as well right so recollect the previous example a friends friend is a friend is all we mean by transitive relation
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:11,3:33,a relation r satisfying this what it does is whenever ais related to a we will put a and a into a set let us call this set s okay when ais related to lets say awe will put that also inside and we say every element here is related to each other because its
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:33,3:50,a transitive relation do we remember from the previous example that when a friend knows someone when e knew d e knew the whole of a b c in the previous example right so on and so forth you will get the set s to be equal to some elements where everyone know each other
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:50,4:10,and then take an element that is not inside s okay lets call it lets say some a and see what a is related to and put that element here and keep going and you will get a brandnew set as you can see none of the elements of swill be related
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:10,4:31,to none of the elements of s why if in case any element of s is related to an element of s then the whole of s will be related to that element in s and s swill not be two different sets please observe that these sand s areobviously subsets of a now as i keep doing this s s
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:31,4:58,s so on i should stop somewhere because the set is finite set a is finite so i will basically be writing a as s u s u s up to lets say sk where where a small bouncer i had although its not that big a bouncer you can understand it but you will find it difficult to make sense of what
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:58,5:23,im saying i see that this s s intersection s intersection s and so on intersection sk is empty by that i mean not just is the case that all these sets dont have a common element no two sets have anything in common in fact si intersection sj is an empty set right
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:23,6:01,so what is it that we are saying this here goes the theorem given a set a with lets say n elements and a relation r which is known to be reflexive symmetric and transitive we conclude that such a relation partitions the set into disjoint subsets so as and always whenever there is a property a theorem the proof looks a little complicated
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:01,6:15,but the idea will generally be simple so i told you the simple version of what the theorem is you can refer to any book any standard textbook the proof will go on the lines that i told you okay so if you are confusedprobably you are confused about the
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:15,6:35,notations the idea is fairly simple whenever you have a set and you have a relation r that is an equivalence relation this r partitions the set a into disjoint sets okay now they say that converse is also true what do we mean by that by that we mean
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:35,7:01,if you are given a partition of a as su s up to lets say sk some partition of a forget about the previous s size that we wrote that was in a different context you simply take ayou classify a as s sup to sk lets say for example you take all citizens of india and classify them based on the states
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:01,7:21,that they belong to okay a person belonging to maharashtra people belonging to karnataka people belonging to tamil nadu are all classified as these sets s s up to sk k is the total number of states in india okay now the converse says what does the theorem state if there is an equivalence relation
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:21,7:50,then a gets partitioned into subsets one can write it as a partitioning the relationship itself induces a partition the converse would be if a can be written as disjoint union of some subsets then you can define an equivalence relation on a such that that induces the given partition what do i mean by that once you see what i am saying
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:50,8:16,what i am going to write next you will understand this statement the converse simply says a is equal to s s up to sk you can actually define a relation r which is reflexive symmetric and transitive and hence an equivalence relation which induces this partition how do you do that very simplefirst take sand define any two elements in s as related go to
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:16,8:37,s and define any two elements in s as relatedokay go to s declare ensure that any two elements of s are related so if two elements alpha and beta are present in s you say alpha is related to beta and beta is related to alpha this is your
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:37,9:02,relation and what you do is to make it reflexive you for every element a in a you say a is related to a okay such a relation will induce the given partition i will not spoonfeed any further this is actually pretty straightforward as and always if it is if youre finding it difficult the problem is with
162.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:02,9:06,notations okay go through it a couple of times you will find it very easy
17.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:03,00:00:10,so far we have seen what is meant by n factorial what is meant by permutations we have seen a video on it we have seen that the formula goes like this npr means picking r items out of n items with the order respected and this is equal to n factorial by n minus r factorial
17.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:10,00:01:02,so this is the formula of permutations now let us solve some problems the first one how many threeletter words with or without meaning can be formed out of the letters of logarithms if repetition is not allowed so the word given to us this logarithms you see logarithms has different letters logarithms
17.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:02,00:01:31,so we have to form threeletter words which can or not have meaning and how many ways can we do this this is the question so let me enumerate some of the threeletter words log oga ari art arh and so on so in how many ways can we do this
17.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:31,00:01:59,so we have letters and we have to form three letter words so it is the problem of picking letters out of letters so it is p which is equal to as the formula says factorial by minus factorial which is same as factorial by factorial and after computation this gives as the answer so in ways we can form threeletter words which need not necessarily have meaning out of this word logarithms
17.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:59,00:02:49,the next question in how many ways can the letters of the word leader be arranged so the word here is leader it has six letters but please note there are two es here unlike in the last question where all the letters were different so we have le this is the first one ader and this e is the second part and the question is in how many ways can the letters of this word be arranged
17.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:49,00:03:55,so we have six letters and two repetitions of e here so the number of ways to arrange our six factorial by factorial the six factorial is into into into into into divided by factorial and this is into into into which comes up to now why did we divide by factorial here the word leader has two es i will mention them as e and e when we arrange the letters of the word leader in different ways in case i consider e and e as two different letters if we treat them as distinct letters then there are six factorial permutations but since the letters are the same if we dont treat them as distinct we are over counting and hence we divide by two factorial
17.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:03:55,00:04:27,so the number of ways to arrange the letters of this word are the next question a company has members on its board of directors in how many ways can it elect a president a vice president a secretary and a treasurer so this company has members in its board of directors and four members are to be picked
17.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:04:27,00:05:15,so its same as asking the question picking four out of and this goes by p which is factorial by minus factorial which is factorial by factorial and this is the same as into into into and this comes up to the next question in how many ways can the word holiday be arranged such that the letter i will always come to the left of the letter l so the word holiday has all distinct letters and the number of letters are and therefore there are factorial ways to arrange the letters
17.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:05:15,00:05:48,now there is a constraint here the number of ways such that i comes to the left of the letter l we have to compute how many times this happens so you see that either i should be to the left of the letter l or to the right of the letter l so in exactly half of the arrangements it will happen
17.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:05:48,00:06:15,so in factorial by and these many number of arrangements letter i will always come to the left of the letter l so factorial by which comes up to be into into into into so these many number of ways the letter i will come to the left of the letter l
17.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:06:15,00:07:03,let us move on to the next question find the number of permutations of the letters of the word climate such that the vowels always occur in odd places so the word here is climate and you see it has no repetitions but the condition given is the vowels should always occur in odd places
17.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:07:03,00:07:23,let us understand this so we see that the word climate has four consonants c l m and p and three vowels i a and e it has the total number of letters are seven and we have seven slots like this and the words can occur here in these seven places
17.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:07:23,00:07:59,so you see they are odd and even slots like this so there are four odd slots and three even slots we have three vowels and they should occur in the odd places so in how many ways can we arrange this so total number of odd places are four and we have three vowels so the number of phase three vowels can occur in four odd places
17.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:07:59,00:08:43,the same as for p which is nothing but four factorial by three factorial this is nothing but four factorial by four minus three factorial and this is four factorial by one which is nothing but so in ways the three vowels can occur in four odd slots you see there are only three vowels here and four consonants so we still have four places remaining after the three vowels take three places so the four consonants can take rest of the four places in how many ways
17.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:08:43,00:09:12,in p ways which again comes up to be four factorial by factorial which is nothing but and we have here so in ways the four consonants can take four slots so the total number of permutations which are possible is into and this goes by the rule of product because we even want that the vowels should take the odd places and the consonants taking the rest of the places
17.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:09:12,00:09:42,so both these events should occur and we have possibilities for each of them and hence the total number of permutations are into which comes up to be in how many ways can mathematics be arranged so that the vowels always come together so the condition here is the vowels must come together so the word is mathematics and the vowels here are a e a i and the consonants are m t h m t c s
17.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:09:42,00:10:11,yes so ill do one thing ill consider these vowels as one unit and these consonants there are eight letters here we see that m appears twice and t also appears twice let us first compute in how many ways we can arrange these consonants so there are eight letters and we have two letters which repeat m and t
17.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:10:11,00:10:46,so the number of ways of arranging m t h m t c s is equal to factorial because there are eight letters by factorial into factorial this is for m and this is for t so this goes for the consonants now we saw that the vowels were a e a i in how many ways can we arrange this this is factorial because there are vowels and they say that a is repeating twice and hence we divide by factorial which is the number of ways of arranging these vowels
17.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:10:46,00:11:40,so we have computed differently for consonants and for vowels so the total number of ways in which this entire word mathematics can be arranged so that the vowels can always come together are factorial by factorial into factorial into factorial by factorial again by the rule of product you see i treated this a e a i as one unit because they have to always come together and so these many number of ways the word mathematics can be arranged so that the vowels come together
18.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:00,0:23,here we present yet another counting strategy called the combinations there is a strong link between permutations and combinations which one has to observe carefully we will as and always solve a lot of problems to make the concept clear to your minds you will appreciate and enjoy the beauty of this concept
18.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:23,0:40,it is elegant yet very rigorous now getting back to our five friends where three people came forward and took their photos in all possible ways what if our friends decided order is not important how does it matter it is three of us taking a picture together that matters
18.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:40,1:20,so let us not try all possible positions with three of us let us just take one picture of all three of us so given five friends in how many ways three people can come forward and take a picture without worrying about all possible orderings what we have been seeing so far is npr the p there stands for permutations
18.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:20,1:52,so we saw that given n people if you pick r people with order respected you will have npr number of choices now let us get back to our previous example of five people and three of them trying to take a picture you have a b c d and e and you have three people taking all possible pictures
18.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:52,2:09,if you remember it right we saw that for every choice of three people we had three factorial photos now let us modify our question the modification is that these three people once they come forward of course two people go backward and three people will come forward and these three people can change their positions and take three factorial pictures
18.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:09,2:33,what if they decide that hey come on all three of us are in the picture why does order matter let us take only one picture with three of us in it in some order then in how many ways can these five people take pictures with three people in it not worrying much about all possible order in which these three people can take pictures
18.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:33,3:10,they just stand in some order and click a picture in how many ways can they click let us go ahead and enumerate it the way we did for the previous case so abc come forward de step backward abc take a picture now please note acb is not another picture
18.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:10,3:49,abc take a picture and boom its over next comes ab and d another pictures and they are done abe is at another picture and then we have acd ace then ade followed by bcd bde and then finally cde so you have one two three four five six seven eight nine and finally i have left out just one thing which is bce i left that out
18.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:49,4:30,it should be here bc and e which makes it one two three four five six seven eight nine ten there are ten possibilities in which three people can come forward and take pictures out of five people so this is same as the previous one just that we dont take the factorial combinations of each option which means every single person appeared three factorial number of times in the previous case while these three factorial amount of counting will not happen
18.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:30,4:54,correct so p was the total number of ways and i am now going to ensure that i divide this by factorial which gives me the answer from my question in how many ways can five people take a picture with three people coming forward not worrying much about the order
18.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:54,5:25,this goes by the name combinations so c stands for in how many ways can you pick three people out of five people not worrying much about the ordering of these three people once picked
19.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:25,let us look at the same old question ten people four people step forward to take their picture now what if our order wasnt important it would become choose correct in how many ways can four people step forward and take a picture of four people not worrying about the order
19.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:25,0:49,right this is going to be the same as p with some division factor so what are you going to divide you are going to divide this by four factorial because no four people will try all possible four factorial combinations think about it so in general nc will be given
19.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:49,1:00,one can compute this with the formula np divide by four factorial in general ncr will be npr divide by r factorial
2.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:45,00:01:06,i am shredding these papers so you are going to tear it continuously until you cant tear anymore is it yeah thats what i am doing to do assume a very big sheet of paper is given to you and you tear it times one after the other pile it up tear it pile tear it and keep them on top of each other
2.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:06,00:01:28,how tall do you think it will be do you saw the question here the question is if you keep tearing a sheet of paper and keep piling it one on top of the other after roughly plus such attempts and in case you can pile all the sheets one on top of the other it will be enough for you to step on it and touch the moon
2.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:28,00:01:51,by that i mean it will be that the pile will be so tall that it will cover the distance between earth and the moon what do we infer from this we infer that counting has a different connotation here by counting we mean count the number of objects in a system
2.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:51,00:02:20,the system here was as you keep tearing the paper you would want to count the total number of papers you are piling it bigger and bigger you see and then you step on top of the pile and your height increases the point is if you tear it roughly lets say times and then stand on top of it you can touch the moon
2.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:20,00:02:40,the point is its unbelievable but true that it very rapidly increases when you keep doubling the number of sheets that you have by tearing all of them and then piling it and then tearing all of them and so on so a word of suggestion but one should not take this example very seriously because you see its practically not possible for one to tear a piece of paper beyond lets say
2.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:40,00:03:16,five iterations one two three four five and it gets very thick you cannot in fact tear up to times its theoretically possible one can talk about it but practically one cannot tear so much but this apart the point to note is that counting is indeed important let us see another example to illustrate this fact
20.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:37,before solving a lot of problems on combinations let us see some nice results nc is what is choosing objects from n objects but in how many ways can we do this as the formula goes it is n factorial by factorial into n minus factorial which is same as n factorial and we can cancel the n factorial in the denominator and the numerator
20.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:37,1:06,and we get by factorial and we know that factorial is hence nc is so there is precisely one way in which you can choose objects from n objects the statement choosing objects from n objects might be a little very weird but whenever we encounter with nc we generally write it as
20.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:06,1:27,ncn is choosing n objects from n objects so in how many ways can we do this with the formula it is n factorial by n factorial into n minus n factorial which is same as n factorial by factorial into n factorial and this is again as we have seen in the
20.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:27,1:31,previous one so there is one way in which you can choose all the n objects from the given n objects
21.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:34,we are now going to see how ncr is equal to n minus cr plus n minus r okay so this just follows from our definition of ncr what is that ncr is given by factorial n divided by factorial r times n minus r factorial now that becomes your left hand side
21.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:34,0:56,right perfect now what is the right hand side n minus cr which becomes n minus factorial divided by r factorial times n minus minus r factorial plus and this n minus cr minus becomes n minus factorial divided by r minus factorial into n minus minus r plus factorial
21.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:56,1:14,why is that i just subtract n minus and r minus rather rather r minus is subtracted from n minus thats why you get n minus minus r minus of and minus minus becomes plus so you have a minus and a plus here which gets canceled which gives you simply n minus r factorial
21.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:14,1:35,here so this is the same oldschool method of trying to prove a formula by showing that the left hand side is indeed equal to the right hand side lets see how we can proceed as you can see there is an n factorial in the numerator on the left hand side and n
21.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:35,1:57,minus factorial on the right hand side so i will take n minus factorial common on the right hand side and then bring that down to left hand side which makes it n factorial divided by n minus factorial which you all know what is factorial by factorial it is simply right
21.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:57,2:13,so n factorial divided by n minus factorial happens to be n correct so you get an n here and these things numerators become one and one on the right hand side okay and then next do you observe r factorial in the denominator throughout and an r minus one factorial here
21.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:13,2:30,so what i do is i will multiply the numerators by the r factorial so what do i get r factorial gets cancel here when i put r factorial numerator on the left hand side and then r factorial again on the right hand side gets canceled but when you put an r factorial
21.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:30,2:48,here in the second term r factorial divided by r minus factorial gives you r so r remains the numerator right and then the next step do you see whats happening im multiplying throughout by n minus r factorial right and that gives me simply a little observation one more step tells me this simply makes this
21.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:48,3:09,n equals n minus r the first term becomes n minus r right rest gets canceled plus r so n equals n minus r plus r plus r minus r gets canceled this implies n equals n of course left hand side is equal to right hand side and so you
21.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:09,3:42,go back and you say that the formula is indeed right so how do we show that ncr is equal to ncnr right in a very mathematical way so what is ncr factorial n divided by factorial r into factorial n minus r correct but what is n choose n minus r
21.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:42,4:04,it is n factorial divided by n minus r factorial times n minus of n minus r factorial you see n and minus n gets canceled and this becomes r here and as you can see the left hand side is equal to right hand side remember this is how we used to show a lot of things to be true in our school days basic
21.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:04,4:11,algebra right so lhs is equal to rhs and hence we show that ncr is indeed equal to ncnr
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:24,so we have seen what is meant by combinations and choosing r items out of n items we also saw certain results on combinations let us now solve some problems so well be going with solving some basic evaluation problems and then moving onto word problems so let us compute what
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:24,1:05,is nc nc by applying the formula we get it as n factorial by factorial into n minus which is factorial so factorial can be written as into into into into factorial by factorial into into into factorial can be canceled on the numerator and the denominator and after simplification we get the answer as what is c applying the formula we see
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:05,1:40,that it is factorial by factorial into minus which is factorial this is same as into into into factorial by into into factorial factorial gets canceled on the numerator and the denominator and after simplification we see that choose is please note choose is same as coose and hence is also equal to choose
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:40,2:11,now what is c c so let me remind you that we had seen a result earlier n minus choose r plus n minus choose r minus is equal to n choose r so we need not compute these terms individually so i will directly observe what is n and r and calculate ncr so by observation we see
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:11,2:52,that n comes up to be and r is and then c is given by factorial by factorial into minus which is factorial now this is into into factorial by into factorial factorial gets canceled on the numerator and the denominator and hence we get so choose choose is same as choose which is equal to now what is choose choose applying
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:52,3:32,the same formula again let me tell what is n it is and r comes up to be and hence well calculate only choose now this is equal to factorial by factorial into minus which is factorial so after computation we see that it comes up to in a cricket championship there are matches if each team plays one match with every other
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:32,3:55,team what is the total number of teams you see there are matches and it is also given that each team has played with every other team so there are matches in all and hence nc comes up to be now what is n is the question how did we get nc as you see there are
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:55,4:22,n teams and each team plays with the other team and hence it is nc and it is given to be so this nc can be written as n into n minus into so on up to into by n minus factorial into factorial now simplifying we get n into n minus by this is equal
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:22,4:51,to this implies n into n minus is equal to therefore solving this equation we see that n is and hence there were teams where each team played with the other team and we had matches let us move on to the next question find a formula for counting the number of diagonals in
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:51,5:13,a convex ngon so we have to count the number of diagonals in a ngon so what is an ngon n stands for the number of sides you see if it is then it is a square if its its a pentagon and if its its hexagon and so on so we have to count the number of diagonals possible
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:13,5:36,so you see diagonal is connecting a vertex here with another vertex here so like this like this and so on so we have to exhaust all the possibilities of drawing diagonals we dont consider these n sides so what is the number of diagonals we should connect every two
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:36,6:03,vertex like this and hence it is n choose and we dont count these sides and hence it is minus n so the total number of diagonals is n choose minus n which comes up to be n factorial by into n minus factorial minus n now n factorial by factorial into n minus factorial is n into
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:03,6:27,n minus by minus n now this is equal to after simplification n into n minus by now this gives us the number of diagonals in any ngon so you see we have to have a minimum of for n so if i substitute that is in a triangle we dont have any diagonals
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:27,6:49,as every vertex is connected to every other vertex let me tell for n is equal to which is a square so when i substitute n equal to i get into minus by which is by which is so we have two diagonals in a square and so on so we can compute this for any n
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:49,7:17,a question paper consists of questions divided into parts a and b each part consists of questions a candidate has to answer six questions in all of which at least two should be from part a and two should be from part b in how many ways can a student select the
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:17,7:38,questions if he can answer all equally well so you see the question paper has questions which is divided into part a and part b each of them have questions and the candidate has to answer in all where he has to answer two from part a and two from part b compulsorily so in how
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:38,8:00,many ways can he answer six questions let us now see what are the possibilities the student has let me write down possibilities from part a and part b so either he can answer two from part a and four from part b this sums up to be six or he can answer three from part a and three from part
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:00,8:26,b or four from part a and two from part b because of the minimality condition that at least two we cannot have one here and five here so for this first possibility two from part a and four from part b in how many ways can he do this it is choose into choose by rule of products
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:26,8:45,because there were five questions in part a and five questions from part b and he has to choose from a and from b so this comes up to be after evaluation as and for the second possibility that is answering from part a and three from part b the number of ways he can do
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:45,9:10,this is choose into choose which comes up to be after evaluation now for the third one which is answering for questions from part a and two questions from part b again this is similar to the first possibility the answer comes up to be so for possibility he has number
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:10,9:36,of ways for possibility two he has hundred ways and for possibility three he has ways so the total number of ways the student can select the questions is plus plus by the rule of sum which is because either he can choose this possibility one or possibility two or possibility
22.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:36,9:44,three he can follow any of these three and hence by rule of sum we see that the answer is
23.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:25,well so till now we have seen what was permutations what was combinations their respective formulas how to denote them the notations several properties of combinations and we have solved a lot of problems on both permutations as well as combinations but what is the subtle thing if to remember here is the difference between
23.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:25,0:57,permutations and combinations let me now state it when we speak of permutations we always keep in mind the order order is very important or it matters when we speak of permutation whereas when we speak of combinations we dont give much importance to order rather order does not matter in combinations in permutations we speak of arrangements like arrangements of the
23.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:57,1:10,alphabets and so on whereas in combinations we speak of selection or choosing elements from a given set so please keep this in mind whenever you are learning permutations and combinations
24.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:41,imagine there is a icecream vendor he sells three different flavors precisely three flavors what are those vanilla flavor chocolate flavor and mango flavor and he has a whole lot of these icecreams of these individual flavors assume kids visit his shop and they all take the flavors of their choice and the shopkeeper notes that there is a possibility that he sells these ten
24.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:41,1:14,kids ten icecreams all of them being vanilla or all of them could be chocolate and all these could be mango or another possibility is three vanilla two chocolate and five mango flavor of icecream now our question is in how many ways can this vendor sell ten icecreams three flavors
24.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:14,1:36,so a point to note is actually a possibility of confusion i am not trying to see this question in the light of the kids there if ten kids can buy icecream in so many ways but i want to see it in the perspective of the shopkeeper in how many ways can he sell ten icecreams with
24.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:36,1:42,three flavors right there are so many ways let us count what are these ways
25.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:04,0:43,so the solution is actually very short and sweet let me explain it properly look at this vanilla chocolate and mango are the three flavors a possibility is two vanilla three chocolate so four chocolates and four mango amounting to ten correct or lets say one vanilla one chocolate and eight mangoes right or maybe all vanillas no chocolate and no mangoes all these
25.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:43,1:06,are valid ways of selling ten chocolates three flavors now what i will do is i will visualize this very thing in a particular way that makes my counting easy what do i do i will take one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve slots and two sticks i
25.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:06,1:39,put a stick here and maybe here which denotes that always the first cell denotes vanilla ice cream zone second cell is the total number of chocolate icecream that he sells and the last one denotes the total number of mango flavored icecream that the shopkeeper sells so here in this instance two plus four plus four right is basically the same as putting a stick
25.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:39,2:05,in the third slot and eighth slot correct so that corresponds to my first possibility second possibility is putting a stick in the second slot and fourth slot and finally this last thing where he sells all vanilla is putting the sticks in the last two slots denoting that between the
25.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:05,2:34,first stick and the second stick there is nothing which means he doesnt sell any chocolate flavored icecreams and after the last stick there is empty space which means he doesnt sell any mango flavored icecreams and so the total number of ways in which the shopkeeper can sell icecreams of three different flavors is simply the same question can be converted the question of
25.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:34,3:03,in how many ways can you put two sticks in twelve containers separating ten containers into three different categories correct you have to observe this deeply to understand what i am saying this is one very important problem and it appears in different forms in different places you should quickly recognize the question and you should also know the answer so whats the answer
25.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:03,3:27,the answer is icecreams plus three flavors resulting two separators so it is three minus one you see what happened here three minus one observe carefully you had three icecream flavors and hence you should put two sticks so that you get three categories if there were to be five
25.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:27,3:55,icecream flavors you should put four sticks so it is ten plus three minus one and from that you should choose two placeholders where you can put the stick so the answer is c the question and in general if you were to sell r icecream flavors okay and then if you need to sell it to n kids
25.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:55,4:20,namely n icecreams and the number of flavors is r the total number of ways in which you can sell this happens to be n plus r minus c r minus this concept goes by the name combinations with repetition a very important one well see more examples of this in the next video
26.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:05,0:39,so here is a question in how many ways can we write as sum of four numbers that is abcd should be equal to now you see becomes this is one possibility please note is another possibility you see change of ordering leads to another possibility that is how we are counting here
26.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:39,1:03,so you probably are wondering why should we consider these two are different possibilities that is a rule led by us right i mean thats how we are going to count so in how many ways can we write as abcd and please note we say nonnegative integer which means is also allowed
26.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:03,1:43,so is one possibility is another possibility is another is another so let us answer this question now that you are very familiar with the formula you already see that this is nothing else but slots plus three separators so its going to be slots and in this in how many ways can you place three placeholders
26.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:43,2:19,which will be c n plus r minus c r minus and here is r here is four so its going to be plus minus c minus which is c assume i have this jar which can contain candies and these candies come in seven different colors lets say seven different flavors and seven different colors
26.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:19,2:47,and let these colors be vibgyor which is violet indigo blue green yellow orange red the question now is in how many ways can i fill this jar which can actually hold candies with candies which come in seven colors corrrect now isnt this question the same as in how many ways can you write as a plus a
26.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:47,3:25,plus a plus a plus a plus a plus a think about it correct you see you pouring violet candies is one possibility that translates to correct and so on so whats the answer pretty clear so equals slots which is n plus r minus c r minus i have a advice for you all and the advice goes like this do not see the formula always
26.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:25,3:54,try to solve it without the formula and try to get used to the formula so what will be the answer slots and placeholders six vertical sticks in how many ways can you put six vertical sticks on slots that would be n equals r equals n plus r minus turns out to be c and there
26.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:54,3:58,we are thats the answer
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:04,0:28,remember ab square is a square b square ab this was taught to us in our school days we will now see a generalized version of this result called the celebrated binomial theorem we are now going to discuss what is called the binomial theorem which stands for simply this
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:28,0:49,it looks very complicated but bear with me there are a lot of interesting consequences of this theorem and in fact the proof of this theorem itself is very interesting and it has numerous applications so we will go very slowly and try to motivate you to understand what entails by binomial
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:49,1:08,theorem what is ab the whole square you are probably wondering what is chap teaching this is something that we learned in our primary school days ab the whole square is a square ab b square as you all know some of the most interesting and most important aspects of math starts
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:08,1:35,from a very elementary example and the motivation for this elementary example is simply a question such as this you will now observe that how that how a bunch of questions starting from ab the whole square will lead to a magnificent concept in this date fine so how do we get ab the whole square expansion we write ab next to each other and then we
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:35,1:52,pick a a here and then a b here we get ab when we pick a b here and then an a here we will again get ab ba rather we write it as ab and then you pick a a here and a a here you get a square
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:52,2:21,then you pick a b here and b here you get b square again very elementary but what i want you all to observe is what happens when we take ab the whole cube you could write it as ab into ab into ab thrice right how does the multiplication actually happen is the question that we are posing here and
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:21,2:41,i want you all to observe how exactly we multiply ab into ab into ab what do we do you pick a a from the first cell i call this a cell and in the second cell you can pick whatever you want you pick a a or a b let me pick a a here
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:41,3:06,third cell again let me pick a a here which gives me a cube this is one way of getting a term in the product another way is pick something here let me choose a let me choose b here and let me choose a here i get a times b times a which is a square b correct
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:06,3:26,and then so on and so forth the point to note here is not the answer on the right hand side the point to note here is how exactly is the multiplication done the answer is the multiplication is done by picking exactly one element from these individual cells and you have three cells
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:26,3:54,what are the total possible ways in which you can pick one element per cell and obtain a term on the right hand side correct so we all know the answer for this if you do continue doing it is a cube ab square ba square b cube you can verify this
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:54,4:31,your ab square comes thrice your ba square comes thrice b cube comes once a cube comes once now let us go forward and try to see what happens if we were to take ab five times what would happen think about it if i were to ask this question what is ab whole to the n its slightly confusing
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:31,4:53,you see ab whole square was very easy ab whole to the cube was also very easy ab whole to the five you also observed what is happening there but in general what is the answer for n now i want you all to visualize in place of n a number ten
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:53,5:11,you are probably wondering why to go from two three five and then ten it is easy on your minds okay generalization and arguing with n as the term anywhere in mathematics is actually slightly confusing we should always use replacement for the number n and then try to think of what would happen
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:11,5:33,if the number is replaced by n so my choice of a number is right now so what is ab whole to the ten let me observe this carefully as and always you have ab ab ten times how on earth will i get a to the here i will only get it in one way
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:33,5:55,why in individual cells all these cells if you pick a a a without picking a b anywhere you will end up having a to the now you have only one way to do that and then if i ask you this question in how many ways can you get a to the the answer
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:55,6:11,is no way how can you get a to the you are forced to pick either a or a b from every cell first cell second cell up to th cell correct and how can you get a to the from ten cells you will be forced to pick a a in the last
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:11,6:31,cell or a b from the last cell so what you can get is a to the times a b correct but in how many ways can you get this in how many ways can you get a to the times b thats an easy question to answer actually observe carefully
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:31,6:51,you can choose a b from any of these ten cells and call it as the cell from where you are picking your b from the rest of the cells you declare that you are going to pick only as now this question boils down to you picking a b from ten cells
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:51,7:13,you can pick that in ten ways correct so this ten will be the coefficient of a to the times b think for a minute so a to the times b you get ten ways in the expansion correct and then my next question in how many ways can you get a to the which means from th
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:13,7:33,cell you pick a and from the rest of the cells you pick bs which is two bs in how many ways can you do this so basically you pick from two cells and declare that only from these two cells you will be picking your b and from the rest of the cells you are going to be picking as only
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:33,7:53,in how many ways can you do that you can do that in c ways you all now know what c means i need not explain why its c why is it thats because given ten cells you touch some random two cells some two cells in how many ways can you do that c ways
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:53,8:10,every time you touch this you declare my bs are going to be from these two cells only once declared rest of the cells you are only going to pick as so you are going to pick as and bs and there are c ways in which you can do this
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:10,8:49,similarly c ways in which you can pick bs and rest of the cells you will pick as let me complete this now finally we have c and no as are picked which means out of cells all cells are bs which means this will be b to the now you see the point i made long back
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:49,9:11,it is not a good idea to write to think anything in terms of generalization in terms of n now you did it for you now know how to do it for n so what is ab whole to the n its going to be a picked from all the n cells plus a picked from all cell except one cell
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:11,9:30,which is declared to be a b cell from where you pick this can be done in n ways to be precise nc ways you see it was in the previous case actually there was c plus in how many ways can you pick two bs into b square nc the
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:30,9:50,remaining is a to the n minus the next term will be nc a to the n minus and i am obviously not explaining i am hoping that you all are following what i am saying so on and so forth upto ncn a to the times b to the n
27.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:50,10:03,what we have obtained just now is called the celebrated binomial theorem with enormous applications let us now see a few applications of this result
28.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:01,0:30,so we have seen what the binomial theorem states let us now see some beautiful applications of it you all must have heard of plus by n whole power n when i apply binomial theorem on this let us see what the terms are plus by n whole to the n becomes nc power n into
28.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:30,1:08,by n whole power plus nc power n minus into by n whole power plus nc power n minus into by n whole square plus nc power n minus into by n whole cube and so on when i expand this i will get nc to be power n is again into plus nc is plus
28.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:08,1:40,again to the n minus becomes into nc becomes n into into by n plus nc can be written as n into n minus by i have written this by simplifying nc into into by n square plus nc can be written as n factorial by factorial into n minus factorial into by
28.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:40,2:13,n cube and so on this becomes plus the ends get canceled here plus ill cancel n from the denominator and the numerator and what remains is n minus by into n and now simplifying the next term we get n into n minus into n minus by factorial into by n cube plus so on
28.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:13,2:45,now this becomes plus plus let me take a n common from the numerator here and this becomes n into minus by n by into n plus we have n here and n cube here so after simplification what remains is n minus into n minus by n square into factorial and so on now this
28.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:45,3:13,one ill write it as factorial and this i will write it as by factorial plus you will understand why im writing like this plus i cancel these ends here and i get minus by n by is same as factorial and hence ill write this as factorial plus again as i
28.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:13,3:39,did earlier ill take out ends common in these two terms so i will get n into minus by n into n into n minus by n i hope the step was clear by n square into factorial plus so on now ill cancel these ends with n square and what remains is zero factorial as we have seen earlier
28.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:39,4:13,is one so it does not make a difference if i write by factorial plus by factorial plus minus by n by factorial plus minus by n into minus by n by factorial and so on now what happens to these terms when n becomes sufficiently large what i mean by
28.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:13,4:46,sufficiently large is we have to choose n to be a very large number in case n happens to be a very large number then by n or by n or any small number by n becomes very close to and hence this term can be written as by factorial plus by factorial plus i am approximating this
28.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:46,5:16,by n to be a number very small very close to and hence this becomes by factorial im neglecting the terms which have denominator as n and hence in all the further terms what will i get it will become by factorial plus by factorial and so on so this becomes summation
28.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:16,5:52,by k factorial k from to infinity now this is called the famous eulers number im sure you must have heard of e and this we have arrived at this by starting from expanding plus by n whole to the n by using binomial theorem so this was one application of binomial theorem
28.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:52,6:16,now let us see the next one the derivative of x to the n involves binomial theorem now derivative is a concept from calculus and i am talking of binomial theorem so how is it related the proof involves certain technicalities from calculus and i leave it to you guys to go and check it i am
28.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:16,6:39,not giving the proof of the derivative of x to the n here but let me state it the derivative of x to the n is n into x to the power n minus and this involves the usage of binomial theorem let us move on to the next one we know that binomial theorem states that x plus y whole to the n is
28.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:39,7:11,summation k from to n nck into x bar n minus k in the y power k what happens when i plug in x and y as so it becomes plus whole power n equals summation k from to n nck so in place of x and you i am writing it as and hence this becomes to the n minus k into to the k now
28.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:11,7:39,you must be wondering why i am doing this because im just plugging in for x and y but let me tell you this is power n equals summation k from to n nck so did you observe what happened we have as a summation only the binomial coefficients and the sum of all these binomial coefficients turns
28.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:39,8:03,out to be power n what does this actually mean if we have n objects each time we choose k objects from these n objects like im choosing from n objects im choosing one object from n objects two objects from n objects and so on and i add up all this so what it becomes
28.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:03,8:24,it results in power n did you see the beautiful connection between binomial theorem and choosing objects from n objects and power n so these were a few applications of binomial theorem next well move on to the generalization of binomial theorem and solve a lot of problems
29.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:27,let us now see some interesting properties of binomial theorem let me again recall what the binomial theorem states x plus y whole power n is summation k from to n n choose k into x power n minus k y to the k now what if i replace x by and y by x so i basically i
29.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:27,0:49,want the expansion of plus x whole power n so this is a particular case what we are going to see so what is the expansion of plus x whole to the n be summation k from to n n choose k to the n minus k into x to the k so this happens to be summation k from to n
29.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:49,1:12,n choose k into x to the k because the rest of the terms here is and hence we have n choose k into x to the k so whenever we have something like plus x whole square or plus x whole cube or any n for that matter you need not basically expand everything you can directly write it as n
29.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:12,1:42,choose k into x to the k the terms will be these the next property when i expand x plus y whole power n i have these terms n choose x power n y to the plus n choose x to the n minus into y plus n choose x to the n minus into y square and so on and the last term would be n choose n
29.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:42,2:08,x to the into y to the n now what is the first term it is n choose into x to the n y to the is and n choose is again and therefore i have only x to the n as the first term the second term is n choose into x to the n minus into y the third term is n choose into x to the n minus
29.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:08,2:38,into y square and so on now when are we getting to let me generalize the rth term will be any general r term will be what n choose r minus into x power n minus r plus into y to the r minus this might seem to be complicated but let me just tell you observe the patterns in the terms
29.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:38,3:09,here consider the third term we had n choose the third term has n choose x to the n minus so if i consider r to be n minus plus minus plus is minus and hence n minus we have and y square your r was so you have a here so this is very helpful in solving problems so
29.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:09,3:32,the rth term is given to be n choose r minus into x power n minus r plus into y to the r minus so you can have this formula and use it to find any term in the expansion the next property in your expansion you might have several terms but how do we find the middle
29.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:32,3:56,term supposing say n is very large like or you really cannot keep counting the terms one by one to find out the middle term so let us use a nice formula here say n is even then what then there is only one middle term which is the n plus by the th term so the n plus
29.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:56,4:29,by this term will be your middle term in the entire expression what if n is odd then you will have two middle terms you can consider the example of x plus y the whole cube this is x cube plus y cube plus x square y plus y square x you can rearrange this and get it as x plus x
29.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:29,4:53,square y plus y square x plus y cube you have two middle terms you cannot decide this as a middle term or this as middle term so you consider both of them and therefore if n is odd we have n plus by th term and n plus by plus this term is also the middle term and
29.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:53,5:18,hence we have two middle terms if n is odd i hope i am clear till now the largest coefficient in the expansion of x plus y whole power n will be the coefficient of the middle term this must be quite intuitive because you see in the expansion n choose
29.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:18,5:38,and n choose n both turn out to be you see the coefficients keep increasing till a point and then go on decreasing so the point where it is highest is the coefficient of the middle term so this was some of the nice properties now let us solve some examples
3.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:08,00:00:26,do you know how to solve a rubiks cube no so you are trying to exhaust all possible configurations is it yes i think its easy how hard it can be how many configurations do you think a rubiks cube has its very small i suppose a couple of hundred
3.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:26,00:00:48,you see what just happened two friends are discussing how difficult it is to solve a rubiks cube look at rubiks cube such a small object you see you can rotate on one of these six sides at a time and then you should arrive at the right configuration which is every side should have the same color
3.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:48,00:01:06,how tough is this let me try to simplify the question and ask you all is it easy to solve x x rubiks cube which looks like this how easy is it what are total possible combinations that you can do with x x how many possibilities for x x x x
3.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:06,00:01:33,have you seen a rubiks cube x x i have i have seen x x rubiks cube it looks of course more complicated but can you guess the total number of ways in which you can switch rotate look at all possible configurations of a x x rubiks cube let me tell you people the exact answer
3.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:33,00:02:13,wait for me i have written down all the all possible ways in which you can enumerate a rubiks cube so a x x rubiks cube has combinations which is roughly lakhs what about x x it goes like this it has so many combinations  its a huge number how many digits i cant count
3.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:13,00:02:30,maybe you can count so these many combinations and these many seconds is more than the age of the universe as we have been talking look at the next one if you were to take a x x rubiks cube so just for fun let me tell you how many combinations this will entail to
3.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:30,00:03:01,so it is going to be i dont even know the unit here so i am just going to enumerate my challenge would be to enumerate this pronounce this in a single breath so the point is you increase the rubiks cube one dimension you see a humongous change in the number of configurations
3.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:03:01,00:03:23,so people are now wondering how to solve a x x rubiks cube fast that itself is a huge question x x is actually out of question in fact you can see a whole lot of youtube videos on speed cubing how people solve rubiks cube in matter of a few seconds but the point is it requires enormous amount of practice
3.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:03:23,00:03:42,if the number of sides of if the configuration keeps increasing let us say x x is humanly impossible to solve it has so many configurations
30.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:04,0:34,the sports club of a school has girls and they wish to form four volleyball teams of nine girls each in how many ways can they do this so there is a sports club of girls and four volleyball teams have to be formed let me name it as t t t and t and each team will have girls
30.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:34,1:06,so to form team one girls will be chosen from girls in how many ways in choose ways let me keep it aside now for team two again girls will be chosen but for team one girls have already been taken and we have minus which is so for team two we have girls remaining out
30.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:06,1:33,of them girls have to be chosen again this can be done in choose ways now for team three what will be the possibility we have plus girls already out out of the girls so we have girls remaining out of them girls have to be chosen and this can be done in choose
30.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:33,1:56,ways and the fourth team will have just girls remaining and they can be chosen in choose ways so for team one we have choose team two we have choose team we have choose and for team for we have choose and have want all these to happen so by the rule of product
30.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:56,2:37,we multiply all these and get choose into choose into choose into choose so in these many number of ways four teams can be formed let me calculate so this becomes factorial by factorial into factorial into factorial by factorial into factorial into factorial by factorial into factorial into factorial by factorial into factorial after
30.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:37,3:13,simplification what remains is factorial by factorial into factorial into factorial into factorial so in these many number of ways teams can be formed with girls in each team so this was an example now let me just write in terms of notations the number of ways to choose n objects from a given set of n objects and n objects from the remaining that is n minus n
30.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:13,3:43,objects n objects from the remaining that is n minus n minus n object please note i am again and again choosing from the remaining objects and this goes on and choosing nk minus objects from n minus n minus n and so on minus nk minus so in how many ways can we do this that will be
30.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:43,4:18,given by n choose n into n minus n choose n into n minus n minus n choose n product goes on into n minus n minus n this goes on up to nk minus choose nk let me repeat it if its not clear you can see it this way were choosing n objects from n n objects from what remains here
30.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:18,4:45,n objects from what remains here and so on up to nk now by simple calculation this comes out to be n factorial by n factorial into n factorial into so on and the product goes on up to nk factorial now this can be written as it can be denoted as n choose n n
30.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:45,5:18,n and so on up to nk what did i do just now i have chosen a particular number of objects from a given fixed number of objects n was fixed and i kept on choosing a particular number that is n n nk from this set n so what we are arriving at is called the famous multinomial theorem so
30.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:18,5:53,what i stated as n factorial by n factorial into n factorial up to nk factorial is called the coefficient of the term x power n into x power n into x power n so on up to xk power nk in the expansion of x plus x plus so on up to xk whole power n you have already seen binomial
30.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:53,6:24,bi means so when k is this turns out to be binomial theorem so this is the generalization of binomial theorem so what we have to keep in mind is that this term n factorial by n factorial into n factorial up to nk factorial will be the coefficient of x power n into x power n up
30.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:24,7:01,to xk power nk so what does this actually mean this means from this set of n objects x is chosen n times x is chosen from the set of n minus n objects n times x is chosen from the set of n minus n minus n n times and so on xk is chosen from the set of n minus n minus n up to minus
30.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:01,7:25,nk how many times nk times and this choosing can be done in n factorial by n factorial into n factorial so on up to nk factorial in these many ways and this is called the multinomial theorem
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:29,so that was a lot of learning on binomial theorem multinomial theorem and all the properties of binomial theorem let us now solve some problems on binomial theorem the first one expand a plus b whole to the this is quite a direct problem you just have to apply the formula here so let me do it now a plus b whole to the after applying the formula
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:29,1:03,will give me choose a to the b to the plus choose a to the into b plus choose a to the b square plus choose a cube b cube plus choose a square b to the plus choose a into b to the plus choose a to the b to the and after simplifying all
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:03,1:31,the combinations that is choose choose etcetera and simplifying we get a to the choose is and therefore we get a to the here plus choose is so it becomes into a to the b plus choose gives me into a to the b square plus choose is a cube
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:31,1:58,b cube plus choose is and hence ill write that as a square b plus choose is same as choose therefore it is a into b to the plus choose is so as you can see here the coefficients go on increasing and at the point they become the maximum and again decrease
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:58,2:21,so this was with a plus b whole to the now let us go on to the next question expand whole to the you might be thinking why am i even asking this question because its very simple to calculate this on a calculator but let us see the beauty of binomial theorem and use it
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:21,2:47,to expand whole to the four so whole to the four i can write it as plus whole to the four now it becomes very simple you can directly apply the formula here please do remember this is in the form plus x whole to the n so as i had told this becomes choose
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:47,3:30,to the plus choose to the plus choose plus choose into whole square plus choose into whole cube plus choose into whole to the four its all here and therefore i am skipping it im not telling it because in every term we have the powers of this gives me plus into plus choose gives me so into plus choose is same as
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:30,4:15,choose which is into cube is plus choose is into whole to the four gives me this number now after multiplication and simplification i will get this as so let me round off this to two decimal places and therefore i will get whole to the four as so you must be thinking it can be easily done on the calculator but did you see
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:15,4:41,the beautiful application of binomial theorem here it can be used for such approximations so the next question find the fourth term in the expansion of x cube by minus by x square whole to the nine so the term seems to be complicated but the problem is very simple so we
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:41,5:04,need to find the fourth term in this expansion so we have been asked to find a specific term and not all the terms so as you remember the rth term was given by n choose r minus a power n minus r plus b power r minus so what is r here r is and let me write the fourth term as t
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:04,5:37,i just denote it like that so t is equal to so n here is as you can see so choose r minus which gives me choose into a power what is n minus r plus n is and r is so we get a power b to the r minus is b cube now so what does a and b here a is x cube by and b is
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:37,6:07,by x square yes so let me substitute them and what do i get as the answer choose gives me factorial by factorial into factorial into x cube by whole to the into please note b is by x square into by x square whole cube so after simplifying choose ill get it as
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:07,6:36,into x to the by into minus by x to the i have just multiplied the powers here so this gives me after simplification minus by x cube you can do the calculation yourself so the answer is the fourth term in the expansion of this gives me minus by x cube
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:36,6:58,i hope it was clear if it is not please pause the video here and there and watch it again now the next question determine if the expansion of x square minus by x whole to the will contain a term containing x to the the question is not difficult let me
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:58,7:22,just explain so the expansion of x square minus by x whole to the we have to find out if in the expansion of this there is a term containing x to the so it is very similar to the previous problem so what is tr tr as we know this is the formula now let me apply the formula for this
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:22,7:48,so how can i get how will i find out if there is a term containing x to the so what i mean here is tr must have x to the somewhere right so how will i get x to the okay let me apply the formula first n is what n is r we dont know so let us keep it as it is
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:48,8:24,choose r minus into a will be x square so it is x square to the power minus r plus into b is by x so it is by x whole to power r minus now simplifying this choose r minus into x to the minus r into minus to the power r minus by x power r minus as you can see this
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:24,8:52,is in the form x power m by x power n and i can write it as x power m minus n ill simplify this it becomes choose r minus x to the power minus r into minus power r minus now so this is the expansion i have i dont know what is r so if there is a term containing x to the
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:52,9:20,then x to the here well have some coefficient like this and that x to the can be equated to x to the power minus r i am equating the like terms on the righthand side and the lefthand side and therefore x to the m is equal to x to the n and this implies x to the m minus n is equal to
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:20,9:47,is if x is not so this is the result we know earlier and therefore i can write this as sorry minus r is equal to simplifying this gives me r is equal to by which is not possible because we know that r must be an integer and hence the expansion of x square minus
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,9:47,10:07,by x whole to the does not contain a term containing x to the i hope it was clear so let us move on to the next question evaluate the whole cube again here it becomes very easy to calculate this on a calculator but let me explain how this can be done using binomial
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,10:07,10:30,theorem so as i had used binomial theorem for approximation i can use it here too in this way can be written as minus this is very simple so cube will be minus the whole cube this is the hint for this question and now it becomes very simple just applying the
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,10:30,11:07,binomial theorem choose into cube into to the plus choose square into minus to the plus choose into power into minus square plus choose into power zero into minus cube so now let me simplify all of this this is very simple and i will get it as its a long number i leave the intermediate steps to you to solve it and
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:07,11:30,im just giving the last answer for you to verify now find the middle term in the expansion of x minus whole power six so a lot of things to keep in mind here first of all we need to find the middle term and the next one is n is even here as we had seen earlier if n is even there
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:30,11:54,is exactly one middle term and therefore we need to find it but what is the middle term which term is the middle term that is given by n plus by n is and therefore it is by which is therefore the fourth term in this expansion is the middle term so now we need to find even the th
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,11:54,12:23,term here so directly applying the formula let me denote the fourth term as t so t is equal to n choose r minus into a to the n minus r plus into b to the r minus so when i substitute i get t is equal to choose into x the whole cube into minus the whole cube i hope it is
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,12:23,13:01,clear because r is equal to four here and applying it appropriately gives me this expression now simplify choose gives me factorial by factorial into factorial into this is x cube into minus so after calculation this gives me minus x cube so this is the middle term in the expansion of x minus the whole power so that is it next question what is the
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:01,13:24,coefficient of x square yz in the expansion of x plus y plus z whole to the four so here comes the multinomial theorem so how do we apply it as i had told you we need to find the coefficient of x square yz here so we have three terms so let me write it in general the coefficient of
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:24,13:48,x to the n into y to the power n into z to the power n is given by n factorial by n factorial into n factorial into n factorial so this is the generalized coefficient now applying it here what do i get coefficient of x square yz is given by n is so factorial
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,13:48,14:18,by factorial into factorial into factorial which gives me on simplification as the answer the last question what is the coefficient of x square x cube x whole cube into x in the expansion of x plus x plus x plus x plus x whole to the so this is a huge term and
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:18,14:48,we have to apply multinomial theorem here so on the similar lines as the previous problem the coefficient of x square we dont have x here into x into x cube into x gives me n is here so we have factorial by factorial into factorial into so there was no x term and hence
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,14:48,15:12,it was x to power so i am not writing a zero factorial here im directly going to x so x is power is and therefore it has factorial into factorial into factorial i hope this was clear and on simplification this gives me factorial by factorial into factorial which is
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:12,15:36,okay so these were some of the problems on binomial coefficients and multinomial coefficients so far we have seen what is binomial theorem multinomial theorem the coefficients how to find a particular term here a specific rth term or a kth term how to find the middle term and we have solved several problems
31.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,15:36,15:45,so now well be moving on to the next concept in the next video if you have any doubts please post it on the discussion forum
32.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:04,0:36,look at these numbers one one one one two one one three three one one four six four one one five ten ten five one what do these numbers represent each line in this triangle represents the binomial coefficients as you can see this is called the pascals triangle and this is a
32.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:36,0:41,very pretty this is a very popular concept in mathematics let us see more of it in detail
33.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:24,so the professor has introduced pascals triangle let us now see some fun and cool facts on it so all of the numbers here in this pascals triangle represents the binomial coefficients but let me now start with the facts the second diagonal this one as you can see goes
33.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:24,0:51,on as one two three four five six and so on and this diagonal represents the natural numbers each row the first row one the second row one onethe third row one two one the fourth row one three three one and so on the sum of the numbers in each of the rows comes up to to the n so
33.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:51,1:19,one is to the plus is to the plus plus is which is square plus plus plus is which is cube plus plus plus plus is which is to the and so on as you observe it represents a power of also now is to the as you can see the numbers
33.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:19,1:48,themselves and is here to the you can see a here which is square you can see a here which is cube and so on isnt this interesting you can also see that the triangle is symmetric what i mean by symmetric if you keep a mirror on and that is on this line if you
33.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:48,2:27,keep a mirror what you have on the left hand side is same as what you have on the right hand side it is symmetric we also see that the fibonacci sequence is formed here how you have a here a here and then plus is here now plus is here plus is here so and so on
33.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:27,3:06,so the fibonacci sequence is seen like this now observe this diagonal what you see here is consider these two elements plus is which is square now these two elements is plus which is this is square plus is which is square so we got square square and square so all the numbers here on this diagonal as you can see if you take the
33.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:06,3:20,sum of consecutive numbers you get them as square numbers so this was another fact so these were some of the cool facts on the pascals triangle i hope this was interesting
34.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:22,we posed a question in the beginning of this chapter and told you that well be covering it at the end of the chapter here we present the concept of catalan numbers this concept appears in many works of computing remember this problem that we started off in the beginning of this chapter
34.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:22,0:46,in how many ways can one start from and then reach without crossing the diagonal right this is a complicated problem and it involves some different method that we have not seen so far lets see how to solve this problem now let me ask you a puzzle here if i start
34.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:46,1:15,from this point and if i have to reach this point in how many ways can i reach there what are the total number of paths that i can take from to reach what i mean here is this is one path to reach this is another path to reach so
34.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:15,1:42,the question is in how many ways can i reach if i start from think about it please try solving this problem the professor is now going to give a constrained version of the same problem let us see the problem now
4.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:11,00:00:33,in how many ways can our friends take their picture one is of course this way and the other way is with their positions swapped so there are precisely two ways in which they can take their picture with three people the possibilities are precisely six and that is because three times two times one is six
4.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:33,00:01:01,let us now see all the six possibilities you see with four people the possibilities are simply into into into which happens to be so whats the possibility for five people as you saw one person has just one possibility and two had two possibilities three was six and four was but as you can see five turns out to be
4.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:01,00:01:28,isnt all that big what if there were six people what if there were ten what if there were and what if there were on average as you can see they are roughly taking one second per shuffle how many seconds will it take for them to go ahead with all possible pictures
4.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:28,00:02:29,seconds thats right but what is there were more people so we saw that one person can take a photo in one way two people in two ways three in six ways four in ways five in ways and was a big number so was people and was so big that if you were to take a picture every second of these people it would take the age of the universe
4.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:29,00:03:06,yes the point we are trying to make here is that certain things can be very complicated although the first few cases looks very simple so one has to be very careful on the number of objects in a system and why are we talking about this we are talking in the sense of computing lets see how and what of it
40.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:22,0:32,no one shall expel us from the paradise which cantor has created for us david hilbert expressing the importance of georg cantors set theory in the development of mathematics our focus so far has been on counting in general counting most of the times involves counting the number of elements in a given set
40.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:32,0:57,now what is a set although most of you know the definition of the set and some foundational aspects of set theory well cover in this chapter those concepts that are interesting and important in the discrete mathematics point of view most of us have studied what one means by a set throughout our school days in fact
40.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:57,1:18,its part of several math curriculums all over the world but still for completeness sake in discrete mathematics we have to discuss about set theory so what i will do is ill very briefly touch upon some of the basic concepts that we all know but ill sort of make it selfcontained that ill not be assuming that you all know it good deal
40.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:18,1:29,ill define everything from first principals i need to solve a whole lot of problems to give us some sort of practice on how to handle a set and what is set theory all about
41.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:41,let me consider the set of all planets mercury venus and so on i write all of them and then let me consider the set of all prime ministers of india you see this is the list let me consider the set of all singledigit numbers which is up to ten of them right let me consider all days of the week comes to be monday tuesday
41.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:41,1:15,wednesday so on up to saturday sunday let me consider the months of the year jan feb march april so on up to december do you see what is in common in whatever i wrote so far they all are called sets in the language of mathematics you see certain things in math is best left undefined
41.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:15,1:42,set is one such thing but for completeness sake we may have to define what is a set and let me do it in about a sentence here a set as you can see above is a collection you collect a few objects collection of a few objects that is what you mean by a set in fact there are a whole lot of
41.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:42,2:10,paradoxes involving sets so if you start defining exactly what is a set youll run into problems but throughout our course by a set we mean a list of things a list of things and this list as you saw above that all finitely many but a set can indeed contain infinitely many entities
41.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:10,2:42,for example set of all numbers starting from so on up to infinity set of all even numbers right set of all prime numbers right and so on so you just now saw that a set can be finite or also infinite before going any further let us look at some handy notations let me consider a
41.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:42,3:10,set lets say s with elements a b c d please note a set can have anything as its elements and mostly we use capital letters to denote the set and generally we use small letters to denote the elements of the set there is no hard and fast rule but this is mostly the convention all right
41.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:10,3:45,so now as you can see a is an element of s or we can say a belongs to s theres a notation we use in math for this we say a belongs to s and this is the notation you should get used to and as you know the letter z is not here in the set so we say z does not belong to the set
41.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:45,4:10,let us consider a set of all numbers lets say set a comprises of up to there are many ways in which you can write a set this is a standard notation that im going to tell you right now where i can also write this set which i wrote just now as x such that
41.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:10,4:39,please note it will be very clear to you as you see more examples such that x is between to and x is an integer right so this is same as this but it becomes very handy for you to write something like this for example a set s comprising of all those real numbers between
41.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:39,5:02,lets say and now it is not just difficult but impossible to enumerate it like this there are times when you may want to enumerate it with a definition like this right so a set can be written this way also dont worry much with a lot of examples things will become very clear to you
42.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:33,the notation which we just saw is called the set builder notation why is it even important to study such notations you might think that why are we completing things well actually not its a pretty simple notation it will be very clear with the following examples let us take the set if we write it in the set builder notation it will be
42.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:33,1:03,nothing but x such that x is less than and x is a positive integer within the curly brackets how is it same as let us decode this this is read as set of all x the vertical line is such that x is less than and x is a positive integer so well
42.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:03,1:33,go step by step the condition says that x is a positive integer so well go from is less than yes so belongs to the set so is an element of the set next positive integer is is less than so is also an element of the set then also satisfies this condition also satisfies this condition what about
42.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:33,2:04,is a positive integer but is less than definitely not because its equal to what about the remaining elements what about what about definitely those are greater than so the set which we constructed using set builder notation is which is equal to this set this notation is very simpler than writing this one
42.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:04,2:41,well let me give you another example what if i ask you to write the set having elements to say its instead of writing this what ill do is ill write x such that x is a positive integer and x is less than or you can write x is less than or equal to both are same so now instead of writing to
42.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:41,3:10,im just writing this one liner in the curly brackets x such that x is a positive integer and x is less than now what if i ask you to write a set having elements to the left hand side looks pretty much bigger than the right hand side because right hand side is just the one liner its now the same x such that x is a positive
42.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:10,3:37,integer and x is less than or equal to thats it this comes very handy now just in these cases you might encounter a case where you cannot really enumerate elements of the set give me a set of real numbers between to there are infinitely many elements so you can write this set like this set x such that is less than or equal to
42.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:37,4:02,x less than or equal to where x belongs to the set of all real numbers you might have observe something and even might have concluded that a set is a collection of objects having some properties in common between them like in this example these are all planets these is a list of prime ministers and these are days and these are months or even here
42.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:02,4:33,but that need not be the case see if i write set r with the elements a the alphabet the number nptel new delhi yellow this is a set there isnt any common property among them elements in the set need not be connected with common properties okay lets move on consider the set b consisting of elements and this one peculiar
42.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:33,4:53,property about the set that is the order in which you write the elements of the set doesnt really matter what i mean by this is if someone gives you a set say and if some other person gives you a set say both the sets are same because in the
42.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:53,5:15,set the order in which you write it doesnt matter so you can write and then and then and then or you can start from and then write then write and then two sets are equal if they have same elements a b whenever the elements of a are same
42.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:15,5:47,as the elements of b so here is same as though they are not in the same order the elements in the set are all same let us see this example let me write the set as five and then this is a i have b as are a and b equal of course not because this five which is
42.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:47,6:09,in word is not there in b though the number is there in b so this is an element of a which is not in b a and b are not equal so even if you get one element which is not there in the other set you can tell immediately that those sets are not equal so precisely
42.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:09,6:45,a set means its a collection of unordered objects called elements also in the set repeated elements are counted once let us take the set this is same as because in sets repeated elements are not allowed so this is same as what about in this set two there is no repetition as you can see this two is different
42.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:45,7:16,from this two is different from the number so there are elements in this set the number is called as the cardinality of the set this is nothing but the size of the set so is same as so the cardinality of this set is while the cardinality of this set is so till now we have seen what is called as
42.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:16,7:33,set whats the element this notation the set builder notation and the equality of sets i hope till now its very clear so if something is there which you didnt understand feel free to ask in the discussion forum will be there to help and guide you
43.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:36,let us consider a set s with these elements a b c d e and f now consider another set t that has some elements from s namely a c e and f so this set t is called a subset of s the word subset is rather selfexplanatory we
43.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:36,0:51,use the notation this to denote that t is a subset of s so by subset we mean as you would have guessed a set that comprises of some elements from the set s
44.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:28,we are now going to start with a series of true or false questions let us start with the simplest possible question one can ask on empty sets you have an empty set phi which is denoted by simply open flower bracket and closed flower bracket and thats it nothing is inside now this will be
44.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:28,0:51,denoted by phi which stands for an empty set now my question happens to be this is phi an element of a set containing phi now this is obviously true why is that dont you think this resembles a belongs to a set containing a irrespective of what phi is
44.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:51,1:14,phi stands for an empty set but phi is an object and you are considering a set containing one object and that object happens to be phi irrespective of what phi denotes you should say yes this is true because phi does belong to this set containing one element phi
44.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:14,1:39,a set containing phi does it belong to the set a set containing phi and phi look at this carefully this set containing phi does indeed belong to this set because it is there as an element of this set and hence this is true here is a tricky question
44.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:39,2:02,a set a comprises off as an element and an element which happens to be a set containing now these things are all very confusing that this is it doesnt mean that if you dont get these right you dont know set theory but it is a true test of your complete understanding
44.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:02,2:25,proper understanding of set theory all right so my question would be do you think a singleton set with one element namely belongs to a is this true that belongs to a absolutely yes here is an element of a and this element is indeed belong to a so this is true
44.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:25,2:49,next im saying a singleton by singleton we mean a set comprising only one element singleton one means a set comprising only one element and that one happens to be this element one so does it is it a subset of a yes it is a subset of a why thats because if you
44.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:49,3:20,consider this element alone number and put that in a set this happens to be a subset of this set correct set a and hence this is also true fourth question empty set belongs to a set containing now this is not true why is that thats because you do not spot a phi in the set
44.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:20,3:47,right and hence this is indeed false this takes a minute to sink him many people would think but an empty set is obviously there in the set no by definition we dont consider an empty said to belong to a set in fact an empty set is a subset of any set correct why is that a set containing
44.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:47,4:13,no elements is obviously a subset of any set that you can think of by definition of subsets correct so the answer is false okay look at this question stare at this question im not going to state this question stating would be complicated from no onwards so you stare at the question and you tell me whether its a subset or not the left side which is
44.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:13,4:35,basically a set containing a set containing an empty set now thats why i said im not going to recite the question its getting complicated is it a subset of this a set containing a set containing an empty set and an empty set yes it is indeed because let me write down a set
44.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:35,5:05,containing a set containing a dont you think a subset of a set containing a set containing a and another element b thats true because you picked this element set containing a and you put that into a new set which makes it start flower bracket again start flower bracket put a and flower bracket and flower bracket this obviously is a subset of this set
44.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:05,5:29,so and very similar grounds the given question is indeed true a set comprising of an empty set and that within a set that is an element within a set is indeed a subset of a set containing a set containing null set and a null set so here is a bouncer question stare at the
44.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:29,5:57,question the element belongs to the set do you spot this element anywhere in the set no a set containing is different from the element correct so does not belong to this set so this should be false as i said this comes with little bit of wisdom theres nothing complicated about this but it demands that you give it a thought and do not
44.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:57,6:22,you should not jump into conclusions look at this question is empty set a subset of a set containing now if someone were to ask is empty set does empty set belong to a set containing i would say no thats not true but all that we are asking here is if an empty set is it a
44.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:22,6:45,subset of a set containing in fact we discussed already that empty set is indeed a subset of any possible set that you can think of in particular a set comprising of is no exception so indeed an empty set is a subset of a set containing so this happens to be true without doubt
45.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:31,consider a set as with natural numbers integers rationals and real numbers in it so what is a set the set comprises of all natural numbers as a set all integers as another set all rational numbers as yet another set and finally we have all real numbers too now what is the cardinality of this set
45.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:31,0:48,this set simply comprises of elements n is an element of course n is an infinite set in itself but then we should consider it as an element z is an another element q is another and r is the fourth one and hence the cardinality of s happens to be
45.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:48,1:10,here now lets look at this question a set comprising of a and another set a and a set b close the set and close the set how many element does the set contain so this entire thing should be treated as one element a set containing a and a set
45.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:10,1:35,containing b inside the set all this things put together is a set and a is another element a is an element and this stuff is another element and hence the cardinality should be  okay look at this set of all those numbers such that x is an integer and x square is
45.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:35,1:56,thats what this notation denotes look at the set how an elements do you have in this set okay it is that number whose square is not just that number it is that number whose square is and that number should be an integer is it even possible square is
45.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:56,2:32,square is square is a number between to is your and the number whose square is cannot be an integer and hence this set should be empty and hence the cardinality of this set should be what is the cardinality of a set containing phi the empty set so phi as i told you you should not see it as nothingness phi is a set containing
45.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:32,2:46,nothing and it can be treated as an element at times now if you put phi around brackets like this i would say here is a set containing one element and so this set has cardinality
46.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:01,0:28,it is now time for us to put our understanding to test let us now play around with sets by performing a few operations on that let me consider a set u with people and let me represent this people as p p p p p p p p p and p right instead of seeing it as a set im going to take
46.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:28,0:51,a rectangle and put this people here into this rectangle p p up to p you see in this some of them are boys and some of them are girls lets say these people are boys and these people are girls and then again you see im going to use another
46.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:51,1:21,circle to represent that these people are from the state karnataka and these people are from the state west bengal and these are from punjab so there are these people belong to different states and then let me go ahead and also tell you that some of them know hindi and these many people know english and guess what is in between these
46.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:21,1:50,are the people who know both hindi as well as english you see this is called the intersection intersection which stands for those elements that are common amongst these two sets h and e where h stands for those people who know to speak in hindi and e stands for those
46.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:50,2:19,people amongst these people who know english and obviously you will find some people in the intersection of e and h which denotes people who know both english and hindi please note this is a very important symbol well encounter this very often amongst these people assume these many people love vanilla icecream and these many
46.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:19,2:46,love strawberry ice cream you see there can be people who love both vanilla and strawberry now what does this denote this entire circle as well as this entire circle it denotes all those people who love either vanilla or strawberry that is called the union you see the set v and s its
46.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:46,3:14,union comprises of all the people in these circles with simply will be these people and they all are what is this set as you can see v union s is the set of all those people who like either vanilla or strawberry in fact anyone outside these two circles lets say this person does not belong to
46.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:14,3:20,this set for a simple reason that he neither likes vanilla nor strawberry iit madras production funded by department of higher education ministry of human resource development government of india wwwnpteliitmacin copyrights reserved
47.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:35,we now understand what one means by union of two sets let us try defining this rigorously what do you even mean by defining this rigorously you have the set a you have the set b what do we mean by a union b when do we say that x belongs to a union b you say x belongs to a union b if x belongs to a or x belongs to b
47.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:35,0:58,if one of them happens then we say x belongs to a union b thats the definition of a union b how is a set defined it is defined based on what elements are present in it and im defining what exactly we mean by a union b by defining what kind of elements belong in the set an element belongs
47.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:58,1:26,if it either belongs to a or it belongs to b now similarly is the case for a intersection b when do we say an element y belongs to a intersection b whenever y belongs to a and y belongs to b note the usage of the word and here while we used or for union
47.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:26,1:37,we use and for intersection this is like stating the obvious but this is a very rigorous way of defining what is union and intersection which will come in handy in solving a few problems
48.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:28,nita needs to shop for sweets to gift her loved ones on the occasion of diwali she decides on giving assorted sweets as festival gift she goes to a shop nearby and buys two different packets of assorted sweets the first packet has pieces of sweets and they are all of different types
48.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:28,0:51,the second packet has pieces of sweets and all of them again are of different types what do you think is the union of the first packet and the second packet yes it is as you can see now what do you think about the intersection of these two sweet packets
48.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:51,1:22,yes its going to be as you can see so as is evident already union simply stands for all possible unique items in the sets put together and intersection gives us the total number of unique items that are common in both the sets consider the set of all natural numbers n and so on up to infinity right
48.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:22,1:54,now let me consider the following two sets a which is equal to set of all even numbers and so on and set b is equal to set of all odd numbers and so on so what do you think is a intersection b do you see that no even number is odd and no odd number is even and hence there cannot
48.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:54,2:18,be an element that can belong to both a as well as b and so a intersection b is an empty set whenever two sets are such that they do not have any elements in common in other words whenever two sets intersection is empty we call such sets as disjoint sets note well
48.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:18,2:41,be using this word very often from now on okay going ahead what is a union b its very easy to see that a union b is indeed the whole of the natural numbers namely and so on why thats because a number is either even or odd so every natural number appears either
48.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:41,2:45,in a or in b and hence a union b should be the whole of n
49.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:32,let the set a be a set containing a set containing and an element you see this set containing is actually an element of a note this let me now consider another set b which is now if i quiz you what is a union b what will be your answer pause and
49.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:32,0:55,think for a moment well a union b will be without any doubts every element of a will be here which is the set containing is an element of a that will be here set containing is an element of a that is here element is here now b has elements
49.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:55,1:18,i take the union of a and b so is already here which means will come here and will come here now this is the set a union b do not get confused with the possibility that you write a union b as simply the set containing and the set containing and the element
49.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:18,1:35,and say that the set containing is already here so ill not include anything from b no it doesnt work that way the definition of union is this and we need to note that whenever there is a set within a set it is considered as an element right the answer is this
49.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:35,2:00,look at this question a is a subset of b what can you say about a union b now this is like saying in india you have the state called karnataka right if you take all the entire population of india and then add in to the population of india the population of karnataka what
49.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:00,2:18,will you get as a result now dont you think this is a very silly question to even ask right so this is the question that is being asked here in real life the question sounds very silly but set theoretically speaking whenever a set is subset of the other set its union will simply
49.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:18,2:39,be the bigger set so a here is equivalent to karnataka b here is equivalent to india so a union b will indeed be equal to b right now what will be a intersection b what is common between india people of india and people of karnataka itll be people of karnataka right
49.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:39,2:58,so a intersection b will be equal to a so union will give you one set intersection will give you the other set note this carefully think about it look at the question and look at the answer let us look at the problem with three sets the story of union and intersection can actually be
49.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:58,3:27,extended to not just two sets but as many sets as you want so lets look at the example which involves three sets let a be and and let b be and and c and so what do you think is a intersection b intersection c by this we mean what is
49.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:27,3:48,what are those elements common in all three sets a little bit of understanding tells you observation tells you that is in a is in b but not in c is in a and not anywhere else again is in a and b but not in c if you observe closely the only thing that is there everywhere is
49.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:48,4:18,the number and nothing else so a intersection b intersection c happens to be the singleton next question what do you think is a union b union c simply write down all that is visible in a b and c not worrying about repetition so it will be all elements of a comes here and then is already done so ill not repeat it is done
49.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:18,4:44,is done is new ill put here is new ill put here and then coming to c is there is there already is there is there no no is not here so ill put here so my a union b union c will be and let us now look at a slightly more complicated
49.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:44,5:07,question what is a union b intersection c so whenever you encounter something like this you must first try to find out b intersection c inside the bracket see it as one set and take its union with a so what is b intersection c b and c simply has elements in common
49.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:07,5:31,one being and then is in common so let me write down and then is in common ill write down so b intersection c is and its union with a happens to be gets repeated so only once i write is in a i write and this is my answer
5.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:03,00:00:26,we just saw three interesting examples paper folding rubiks cube and the friends taking photos example if you are wondering what has this to do with computing here goes the answer it is indeed important for us to understand when will my piece of program stop it might go on forever what if you are trying to enumerate all possible permutations of up to this is same as people taking all possible pictures
5.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:26,00:00:41,if you were to enumerate all these things on your computer you will not be able to do it for a simple reason that its a huge number of possibilities so all we are trying to say is it is very very very important for us to have an idea as to how many steps will your computer take in order to execute a task
5.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:41,00:01:20,for that we need to understand counting at a very different level and this chapter is all about understanding how to count in a situation where it is not just about its about enumerated all the objects in a system
50.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:23,given a set a and a set b there could be some common elements between them correct how many elements are there in a lets say m number of elements and lets say there are n number of elements in b how many elements are there in a union b thats a pretty simple
50.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:23,0:42,question with a simple answer so we use what is called venn diagrams where we put a rectangle put the set a put the set b also assume that there could be something in common between a and b and then count the number of elements in b number of elements in a and exclude the over
50.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:42,0:53,counted intersection so the number of elements in a union b is simply number of elements in a number of elements in b add it and minus number of elements in a intersection b
51.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:29,here is a good application of what we just learnt consider a set of people in a classroom of students these students play cricket and football so every student is supposed to play cricket or football of course hes encourage to play both if he wants but not many like playing both but
51.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:29,1:03,they enjoy playing at least one of these games so here is the question there are people who say they like playing cricket they never say they dont like football they only say they like playing cricket and people say they like playing football okay now the question is given students if say they like cricket say they like
51.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:03,1:29,football is turning out to be but the number of students is our question is how many students like both cricket and football thats the question the answer is the simple application of the formula that we discussed number of elements in a union b is number of elements in a lets say a stands for cricket b stands for football
51.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:29,1:55,plus number of elements in b number of elements in a intersection b so number of elements in a union b is given there are students number of elements in a is also given like playing cricket number of elements in b is so what is this number here and little bit of calculation tells you that this number is supposed to be which is
51.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:55,1:57,in the intersection of a and b
52.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:26,we saw an interesting result and an application of it now instead of sets what if you had sets by that we mean how would you compute the cardinality of a union b union c well the formula goes like this its a little complicated it is equal to cardinality
52.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:26,0:54,of a cardinality of b cardinality of c the cardinality of a intersection b the cardinality of a intersection c cardinality of b intersection c cardinality of a intersection b intersection c try proving to solve by yourself and if you are unable to prove it dont worry as we told there is a chapter exclusively on this in fact we will be proving
52.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:54,1:12,the generalized case there on what would be the cardinality of the union of some k sets not necessarily k sets it looks little weird you see you add you subtract and then you add you will know the reason for this in the fourth coming chapter called the principle
52.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:12,1:17,of inclusion and exclusion but as of now you can try solving this all by yourself
53.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:28,let us now see how one can construct a new set from a given set by taking all possible subsets of the given set this goes by the name the power set what is more beautiful about power set is its relationship with a binomial theorem let us proceed to see more of power sets
53.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:28,0:46,i planned to go for a hike this weekend and of my students are generally interested to join me for this hiking activities this time im going to ask them they may or may not be willing to come in fact it doesnt so happen that all of them come or all of
53.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:46,1:07,them dont come a part of them might come you see these are my students there is a possibility that some of them come in that case ill put a on top of their head if they come on top of their head if they dont come right in how many ways
53.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:07,1:25,can i go for a hike with all these people by that i mean in how many ways can this people come one way is none of them come thats one way please note another way is all of them come thats another way please note another way is the first person comes or just the
53.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:25,1:31,second person comes or the first person and fourth person comes so on and so forth do you observe something here
54.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:28,five is slightly on the higher side let me take only people lets say a b and c all of them not coming is represented by a coming and b not coming c not coming we represent that by let me write this down this is nobody comes this would be a
54.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:28,1:16,alone comes represents b alone comes represents c alone comes represents a and b come means a and c comes stands for b and c they come and stands for a b c all of them come do you know something we observe something really fascinating here you write all possible binary numbers of three digits and you see
54.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:16,1:38,that for every such binary representation you associate a subset of a b c and for every subset of a b c you have a unique binary representation and you see the number of elements on the right side should be equal to the number of elements on the left side
54.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:38,2:10,and the number of elements on the left side as you all know is to the why is that if you take place holders where each place holder can have a or a there are two possibilities here here here finally giving you possibilities which means there are ways in which you can write a digit binary number and hence there are so many
54.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:10,2:34,subsets of a b c which is to the number similarly as we have been discussing of my students let me know call them a b c d and e because they are in number none of them coming will be lets say a and c come and b d e dont come that
54.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:34,3:02,represents this and so on so all of them coming would be all five are ones these are precisely to the in number and hence total possible subsets of a b c d and e has to be to the so in general you see if there are n elements a a up to an all possible
54.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:02,3:10,subsets of this set will be to the n think about it for a moment
55.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:24,so all that we showed just now is that when you take a set with elements there are to the possible subsets that you can think of note and please note many of us failed to note this fact that an empty set is also a subset apart from the entire set being subset
55.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:24,0:50,and in between there are more subsets such as these put together you see there are to the subsets of these people correct now do you see that all possible subsets of a set is also another set this is called the power set of a set so in general if you take a set with
55.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:50,1:12,n elements the power set will have to the n elements and the proof goes exactly the way we showed you just now there are to the n possible nbit binary strings right there are many proofs for this you have in fact seen the most elegant and the simplest of all proofs using binary
55.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:12,1:40,strings this is one result that appears to be very unclear when you see it in the beginning but it is pretty obvious it is called the de morgans law it goes like this the set a union b take its complement is actually equal to a complement b complement their intersection similarly a
55.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:40,1:48,intersection b complement is a complement union b complement let us see how this is true
56.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:00,0:34,all right so i throw a party to my friends let me call these friends as now these people are not very punctual you know they say they will come for the party and they dont show up it might so happen that all of them come or it might so happen that none of them come let me think of all possibilities none of them
56.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:34,0:59,come i represent it by an empty set all of them come i will represent it by set only comes i will represent it like this and comes and comes only alone comes so on and so forth now my question would be we have asked this question already its a standard question im just trying to pose it like a puzzle
56.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:59,1:23,in how many ways do you think these friends can come home for a party so its about enumerating all possible subsets of a given set so in how many ways can people come one way in how many ways can one person come that is singleton one singleton singleton singleton
56.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:23,1:55,singleton five ways in how many ways can people come dont you think this is same as choose all possible ways in which you can pick elements from elements dont you think the previous one which we simply wrote as was actually choose in how many ways can you pick one person out of people dont you think
56.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:55,2:21,this which corresponded to the empty set was actually choose in how many ways can you choose elements from elements going ahead the total number of ways in which people can come to the party will actually be choose people coming to the party will be choose for people coming to the party will simply be choose way so the total number of ways
56.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:21,2:38,in which these people can come to the party is the sum total of these mutually exclusive things mutually exclusive sounds a little complicated by that all i mean is these are all different events you have to sum them up for you to get the answer for your question which is how many
56.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:38,3:10,possible subsets are there of so choose choose choose choose choose choose is the answer now should i expand this and do a lot of work and then say whats the answer not required we have seen this in the previous chapter right in general n choose n choose up to n choose n is actually to the n if you dont
56.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:10,3:23,know this is the right time for you to revise this see how this is true right lets apply that here and simply say this is going to be to the power of which is and thats the answer
57.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:27,what is the cardinality of the power set of a set containing elements lets say a and b we know it is square which is but let us try enumerating it what all will it have an empty set a set containing only a and a set containing only b and a set containing both a and b so precisely elements
57.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:27,0:47,now let me ask you this question consider this set as another set which set your power set of the previous set s s was equal to a b you saw what was ps now my question is ps is again another set you see one can talk about the power set of this
57.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:47,1:04,power set right yeah i am just trying to give you a complicated question to challenge you people so what will be the cardinality of a power set of a power set of a set s power set of s is to the power of cardinality of s and power set of this will simply be
57.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:04,1:21,to the power of the elements of ps which is to the power of cardinality of s and now the answer will simply be to the power of to the power of cardinality of s right i was very quick in explaining the reason behind this you may want to work out the
57.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:21,1:22,details all by yourself i
58.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:25,considering a class of people lets say there are a a up to a people im handling a class and some of them are present in the class not all are present what do i mean by that by that i mean lets say some students are present amongst these set u which comprises
58.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:25,0:51,of all students a a up to a some of them not necessarily a a up to a some present lets say set p is a subset of u where p is some s s up to s of them are present you see as you can see in this venn diagram you can put a circle and put
58.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:51,1:17,all these s s and so on up to s and what do you observe you observe that there are people outside this circle okay that is called p compliment we denoted as pc which is simply this set u which is a a up to a minus this set
58.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:17,1:40,s s up to s where minus denotes remove all the elements here from this set this is called the compliment as you can see there are couple of very straight forward properties of this compliment set p intersection p compliment is going to be a null set nothing will be
58.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:40,2:05,in common isnt that true by definition and secondly p union p compliment will be your set u so observe something whenever we talk about compliment of a set we need to do it with respect to a bigger set of which the given set is a subset otherwise we cannot talk
58.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:05,2:06,about compliment
59.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:25,compliment of a set seems to be a straightforward concept yes it is and a celebrated law called the de morgans law is an immediate consequence of this concept compliments can swap intersections with unions and unions with intersections let us move on and see more of it this is one result
59.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:25,0:52,that appears to be very unclear when you see it in the beginning but it is pretty obvious it is called the de morgans law it goes like this the set a union b take its complement is actually equal to a complement b complement their intersection similarly a intersection
59.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:52,0:59,b complement is a complement union b complement let us see how this is true
6.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:23,00:00:51,so this chapter is all about training you all on how to count ill give you a good illustration of how counting can get very complicated look at this figure in how many ways can you start from and then reach as you can see this is a grid labeling the bottom left most point as and the top rightmost point as
6.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:51,00:01:14,in how many ways can you reach starting from by using only rights and ups you see this is one way this is yet another way so on and so forth as you can see what are the total number of ways try solving probably the problem that i just now stated is easy
6.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:14,00:01:30,some of you could even figure out the answer we will discuss the answer later but i want to give you a complicated version of the same question what is the total number of ways in which you can reach starting from same question there is a twist here provided you do not cross the diagonal joining and
6.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:30,00:02:12,you can touch the diagonal but cannot cross the diagonal so this is a valid possibility this is another valid possibility and this one as you can see its crossing the diagonal is an invalid possibility now count all those ways which do not cross the diagonal if you think the answer is whatever was the answer without diagonal by two you are wrong
6.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:12,00:02:36,this requires a brand new way of thinking right and observe im asking you to count i am asking you to count the total possible ways in which you can go from here to here without crossing the diagonal this is one of the most important questions in computer science
6.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:36,00:02:51,we will see more of it at the end of the chapter but i am just trying to illustrate to you all that counting can get extremely complicated at times pause the video and think for a while so far i have just been motivating you all to think on the lines of counting and its importance
6.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:51,00:03:22,i even illustrated an example which is nontrivial and im sure most of you did not get even close to the answer for the previous question dont worry well describe that in detail very soon now let us go very slowly and try helping you all im going to help you all to count from some of the basic using some of the basic questions
60.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:32,de morgans law states that whenever you take two sets a and b and its union if you take its complement thatll always be equal to a complement intersection b complement so im going to give you two proofs for this venn diagram proof is pretty straightforward what you do is you write down a you write down b a and b are always going to be like this intersection
60.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:32,0:51,might have some elements it may not have any elements but still well write that down so what is a union b a union b is the entire thing its complement will be what is outside the two ovals so now a union b complement is basically all the dots outside the circle
60.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:51,1:13,now is that equal to a complement intersection b complement now isnt that obvious all the dots outside this circle will also include some elements of a okay and then i take all the dots outside the circle a and all the dots outside the circle b and its intersection
60.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:13,1:28,what will that be any dot that is outside a as well as outside b are the dots precisely here so combinatorially you see that this result is actually true but lets prove it very rigorously
61.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:25,in set theory one of the important problems that you will note and you should learn as a math student or a computer science student is to show when is a set x y now what do you mean by that it looks very weird when i say show that a set x is equal to a set y theres a common trick that
61.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:25,0:55,we use always so concentrate on the trick the trick is if we can show that x is a subset of y we cannot of course conclude that x y you see all we say is y is bigger than x but if we can also show simultaneously that y is a subset of x then we show indeed that x y
61.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:55,1:23,let me illustrate this with a nice example you come and tell me what is your age ill tell you i know your age your age is less than or equal to my age now you know for sure that your age is not greater than mine and i also tell you that my age is also less than or equal to your age
61.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:23,1:45,i repeat your age is less than or equal to my age and my age is less than or equal to your age this is only possible if my age is equal to your age you see these two statements put together implies that equality happens similarly this is very analogous if a
61.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:45,2:03,set is contained in the other set and the other set is also contained in this set then these two sets are the same in fact all those sounds so straightforward that it doesnt deserve any explanation this is a standard way in which we show that two things are equal
61.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:03,2:11,two sets are equal so let us try showing that this very de morgans law is indeed true
62.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:26,pick an element from the lefthand side its a x belongs to a union b complement and show that x also belongs to the righthand side which is a complement intersection b complement so whenever x belongs to a union b complement it implies that x does not belong to a union b
62.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:26,0:50,when will an element not belong to a set union another set whenever that element does not belong to both of them so x doesnt belong to a and x does not belong to b now what does this mean this means that x doesnt belong to a simply signifies that x actually belongs outside a
62.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:50,1:13,x belongs to a complement and x belongs to b complement look at these two statements x belongs to a set as well as another set which means x should belong to a complement intersection b complement pretty simple which implies look at this from where we started x belongs to a
62.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:13,1:41,union b complement we ended up with x belongs to a complement intersection b complement thus proving that a union b the whole complement is a subset of a complement intersection b complement now let us pick an element from a complement intersection b complement and show that also belongs to this lefthand side how tough is it its pretty easy why is that lets see an
62.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:41,2:00,element x rather lets say y we used x already so lets say y belongs to a complement intersection b complement we will observe that our argument will simply be the reverse of what we saw here y belongs to a complement intersection b complement implies y belongs to a
62.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:00,2:31,complement and y belongs to b complement which in turn implies that y does not belong to a and y does not belong to b which means when y neither belongs to a or b y certainly doesnt belong to a union b correct which means y actually belongs to the complement of this set
62.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:31,2:54,so i start off with y belongs to a complement intersection b complement i ended up with y belongs to a union b the whole complement which means a complement intersection b complement is indeed a subset of a union b the whole complement thus establishing this equality
63.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:47,let us now look at a quick application of de morgans law so simplify this set theoretic expression a union of b intersection c compliment the whole compliment which is equal to now apply de morgans law for this a union of whatever is here is another set its whole compliment which is compliment of a intersection union becomes
63.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:47,1:17,intersection de morgans law and then b intersection c compliment was there its compliment you all know that the compliment of the compliment is itself and hence this will be a compliment intersection b intersection c now this is in its simplest form as you can observe the point is to get rid of big compliments on top of the entire expression right this
63.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:17,1:19,makes better sense than the previous one
64.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:29,we will now go ahead and understand what one means by the difference of two sets a and b it is not the same but very similar to the difference of two numbers that we all are familiar already look at this venn diagram you have a set a you have a set b with some possible intersection
64.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:29,1:00,now look at the shaded region what do you think this is this is simply that part of a with commonalities between a and b removed this is denoted by a minus of b now this is not the typical that we know in arithmetic it is slightly different from the typical subtraction what you remove
64.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:00,1:30,is not the whole of b from a you only remove that part of b which is already in a this is called the difference between two sets let me illustrate this with an example let a be equal to and b be equal to and so what is ab
64.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:30,2:05,so in a you have it is also present in b the rest are not in a and they are not in a so ab will simply be and note that a b need not be equal to ba isnt it clear from the example we saw just now ab in our example in this venn diagram happens to be and but ba happens to be
64.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:05,2:35,and in fact they are disjoint ab and ba are actually always disjoint you can observe this you cannot have a common element in aa and ba in fact one can show that ab intersection ba is always an empty set ill leave that as an exercise problem for you all to explore
65.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:23,this ab that we have been discussing has a very interesting form and that is it is actually equal to a intersection b complement so how is that true let us try proving this using the same old technique that we are advertising for a long time that is take
65.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:23,0:47,the lefthand side show that its subset of righthand side and the other way around so let me take an element x belonging to ab this implies that x belongs to a and x does not belong to b only then x will be in ab what does this imply x belongs to a and x does not belong to b
65.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:47,1:15,implies x belongs to a and x does not belong to b means x belongs to b complement which means x is in some set and in some other set means it is there in the intersection of these two sets and hence x belongs to a intersection b complement now this means ab is a subset of a intersection
65.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:15,1:34,b complement now how do we show that the other way subset is also true other way containment we say thats the language containment is also true a intersection b complement is a subset of ab how do we show this very simple take an x in a intersection b complement this means x
65.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:34,1:56,belongs to a and x belongs to b complement im going to be fast now because we have this is not new for us we have solved a couple of problems already implies x belongs to a and x belongs to b complement and now this implies that x belongs to a and x does not belong to b thats
65.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:56,2:15,what your x belonging to b complement means now this observe this what does it say x is in a but not in b which means by definition x should be in a but not in b which means x belongs to ab correct so the inclusion is now proven a intersection b complement subset of ab
65.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:15,2:34,if you observe carefully you will realize that proofs of both the sides this way and that way of containment is more or less the same correct and hence i have shown that ab is indeed equal to a intersection b complement this is true in the venn diagram as well if you look at this
65.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:34,2:59,diagram here a in a you remove those parts of b and what is this equal to it is actually equal to a intersecting with b complement look at this figure shaded figure outside b and that time a only have this moonlike structure in common correct so ab is a intersection b complement
66.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:36,let us look at all my friends my friends have this peculiar characteristic that they either like sugary stuff or spicy stuff some of them in fact like both sugary and spicy stuff but you cannot find a friend of mine who neither like sugary stuff nor spicy stuff so i can write them as everyone who likes sugary stuff i put them in this set s anyone who likes
66.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:36,1:10,spicy stuff i will put them in this set c okay now if i ask you this question tell me those friends of mine who do not like both sugary and spicy stuff they like either spicy stuff or sugary stuff not both so intuitively if you write a venn diagram like this sugary and spicy all im
66.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:10,1:35,asking for is this shaded region and this shaded region this is called a symmetric difference a triangle b thats how it is denoted what is it looks complicated but its pretty straightforward it is nothing else but were using s and c here so ill use s and c s triangle c s remove all
66.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:35,1:56,the elements of c from s and look at c and remove all elements of s from it and take the union of these two things this will denote those elements that are exclusively in s and exclusively in c but never in the intersection this is called the symmetric difference
66.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:56,2:23,here is an exercise problem for you all can you show that the symmetric difference s triangle c whatever we wrote which was actually equal to sc union cs is indeed equal to s union c s intersection c you should jump and tell me that this is very obvious from the venn diagram
66.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:23,2:47,but then can you try showing the two facts that s triangle c is a subset of this right hand side which is s union c s intersection c and the right hand side s union c s intersection c is indeed a subset of s symmetric difference c or triangle c if you can show these two
66.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:47,3:03,things you are through that the equality in fact holds try showing this the way i have been showing containment so far x belongs to the left hand side and hence x belongs to the right hand side and so left hand side is subset of right hand side use that logic
66.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:03,3:22,and try showing this pretty straightforward so we have now come to the end of the chapter set theory this chapter forms the foundation for several advanced topics in mathematics you may want to revisit this chapter again if you feel the need for it the next week we will be training our
66.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:22,3:29,minds to solve puzzles using logical deduction the next chapter goes by the name logic
67.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:30,georg cantor richard dedekind bertrand russell kurt gdel zermelo paul cohan and many more these are a few of the several great mathematicians who have laid the foundations of whatever we have learned this week set theory their contribution is acknowledged worldwide even today it is not very easy to sort out the dates exactly of what happened when
67.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:30,1:02,when we speak about the history of the subject several interactions have led to its development but set theory is actually known to be one persons creation georg cantor early th century saw the inception of set theory where mathematicians were struggling to understand the concept of infinity in cantor formulated real numbers as sequences of rational numbers this
67.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:02,1:30,was a motivational drive for the mathematicians to understand the notion of infinity cantor brought in the concept of proving two sects to be equivalent if there is a onetoone correspondence which is a very powerful concept even today using this cantor also proved that there are infinitely many levels of infinity or there are infinitely many different infinite cardinal numbers i repeat
67.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:30,1:56,there are infinitely many levels of infinity or there are infinitely many different infinite cardinal numbers and that sounds confusing dont worry if you dont understand this if you really want to understand more you can always search the internet there are a whole lot of references further interactions of cantor with dedekind during s developed a mutual respect between
67.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:56,2:23,the two and dedekind was the first one to acknowledge cantors work on infinite sets it was actually disagreed upon by other contemporaries dedekind has developed the concept of cuts which forms the basis for defining real numbers he has shed light on how two infinite sets can be turned similar it was then during s that bertrand russell
67.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:23,2:54,and ernst zermelo independently found that cantor discoveries lead to paradoxes and these paradoxes were in itself very interesting russells paradox is one such contradiction to what cantor stated at the end of s cantor had himself figured out that his theory would lead to contradictions which he had himself told hilbert and russell in a letter though set theory had paradoxes and huge
67.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:54,3:17,debates it did not lose its momentum zermelo in proved that every set can be well ordered which was conjectured by cantor there has also been debates on axiom of choice between kurt gdel and paul cohan this is how set theory has taken shape to what it is today it is impossible to
67.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:17,3:34,mention all the details in this short video clip this must be an initial trigger for you all to read more about the development on the internet now go back to the first lecture of this week read the quote again and you would understand it with a brand new perspective no one shall expel
67.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:34,3:46,us from the paradise which cantor has created for us said david hilbert he just meant he was trying to express the importance of georg cantors set theory in the development of mathematics
68.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:18,to summarize we have learnt everything about sets its unions intersection compliments power sets the de morgans law its applications symmetric difference of two sets and a brief note on the history of sets
69.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:23,0:40,there is nothing as dreamy and poetic nothing as radical subversive and psychedelic as mathematics paul lockhart let me start with a nice story the story is in different pieces we will put together all the pieces in a while so the first piece is you take any number and even number lets
69.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:40,1:11,say and then square it what you get note that is a multiple of okay in general when you take an even number its in the form m and when you square it it becomes the form m you observe that it is always a multiple of so what did we observe even
69.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:11,1:31,square is a multiple of if a number is a square number what do you mean by square number a number whose square root is an integer you see is a square number is a square number a square number a square number a square number being a square of
69.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:31,2:06,is a square number you take any square number that is even so you see doesnt qualify i want a square number that is even lets say is even whenever you pick a even square its a multiple of why is that can you think about it observe can an odd number square become even no which means whenever you have a square number
69.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:06,2:34,it should be obtained by squaring any one number correct so you obtained by squaring which is an even number you obtained by squaring which was an even number so whenever you have an even square you got it by squaring an even number and when you square an even number it gives you a multiple of so what did we observe what can be
69.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:34,3:01,hypothesize now we can say that whenever you spot an even square it is always a multiple of think about it let us now take this number square root of and show that it is irrational most of you know the proof of this i believe but for the sake of being selfcontained in this course let me tell you the proof of
69.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:01,3:24,root being irrational now let me assume square root of is rational by that i mean it can be written as pq which means is equal to p square by q square now please note whenever i write root is equal to pq it means p and q are in its simplest
69.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:24,3:52,possible form for example is same as is called the simplistic form has things in common so you should cancel things off and then write it in its simplest form namely the idea is write in such a way that they do not have any common multiples common divisors rather okay so i write p and q obviously if is
69.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:52,4:16,a multiple of p q cannot be a multiple of p note this if it were to be a multiple of p then you would cancel off for example if you had something like you would write this as and then again gets simplified as six times and seven times
69.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:16,4:40,this gives you so i can assume that p and q are what is called relatively prime their gcd is dont break your head all i am saying is both p and q cannot be a multiple of now is p square into q square which implies p square is two times q square you see q square is even so p square is even p square
69.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:40,5:19,is even implies p is even why we just saw whenever a square number is even then its that number whose square is this number is even is even implies was even is even implies is even correct its only obvious we saw the proof so p square is even implies p is even and you see when p is even p square is a multiple of correct
69.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:19,5:40,we even saw that p is even square is an even number you get a multiple of which means q square is a multiple of which means q square is even why is that times something is a multiple of means that something should be a multiple of correct q square is even
69.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:40,6:02,implies q is even now round this off q is even p is even which means p is a multiple of and q is a multiple of come on is this even possible we just started off with p and q not being multiples of both cannot be multiples of correct thats who we started so what just happened here
69.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:02,6:25,to show the square root of is irrational to prove this statement we assume square root of to be rational let me call that statement as p root is rational and this implied something implied something implied something and finally we arrive at a fact that was not a fact that
69.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:25,6:54,was some weirdity if p implies weirdity then p should not be true correct which means p which is root is rational is not true which means root is irrational so this was the story which i thought i will tell you all observe this story closely you would have seen this proof in your high school days or even before its a very standard
69.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:54,7:14,proof you will see it in many books its also sort of fun math that many people like teaching and learning root is irrational so the point we are trying to make in teaching you why root is irrational the proof of it is to tell you that there is some kind
69.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:14,7:45,of a math in the proof of statement so understand carefully the way we proved that root is irrational is by using some math correct the usage of this math has what is called logical deduction logical deduction so how is it done what is all about what is logic how do you deduce a piece of truth is what makes this chapter
69.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:45,7:48,called mathematical logic
7.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:03,00:00:26,overall it is very unlikely that you solved this puzzle this is nontrivial concept and requires some thinking we will be seeing the solution of this very question at the fag end of this chapter so for now let us forget this question and move on let us go ahead and learn a basic counting principle which happens to be the highlight of this chapter and is an important concept
7.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:26,00:00:52,so please concentrate as you may walk into a restaurant a restaurant that sells pizzas and burgers there are four different types of pizzas and three different types of burgers and i plan to eat one item only either pizza or burger so i have four items to choose from pizza or four varieties to choose from pizza and three varieties from burger
7.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:52,00:01:30,so in total i can order one of these seven items one of these four plus three seven items let me now change this problem onto the following i enter the restaurant and i decide to buy myself one pizza and one burger okay its not just one item but two items but i am sure i will be buying one pizza and one burger
7.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:30,00:02:02,in how many ways can i make my order it is going to be the following in the sense that first pizza first burger and order first pizza second burger a possible second option first pizza and third burger third option second pizza first burger second pizza second burger so on and so forth
7.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:02,00:02:35,so in how many ways can i make my order clearly it is four times three please remember the last time it was four plus three this time it is four into three so its only common sensical to know when to add and when to multiply previous case was addition
7.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:35,00:02:40,this case was multiplication this goes by the title the rule of sum and rule of products
70.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:27,nptel let us consider these two sentences look at the first sentence it says she is beautiful the second sentence new delhi is the capital of india of course these two are not related as it is obvious to you people but then there is a very important difference between that type of sentence that the first
70.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:27,0:53,one and the second one is she is beautiful is a sentence which cannot be considered as true or false why because beauty is a very subjective term right but the second sentence as you can observe that is called a statement because it is this is such a statement such a sentence can only
70.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:53,1:24,be true or false right a sentence like he is very tall you cannot classify as true or false correct so any sentence which can be classified as true or false is called a statement sometimes we also call it a proposition these two are interchangeably used in different textbooks of discrete mathematics but please
70.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:24,1:33,note from now onward we are only going to talk about what is called statements something that can be classified as true or false
71.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:30,what a beautiful evening i am sure you all must be rightly guessing that it is not a statement its an exclamatory sentence what time is it how are you what are you doing well these are some general questions people exchange go to the gym dont eat junk study well
71.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:30,0:57,well these are some commands what we encounter in our daily lives i initially quoted about the evening then i asked certain questions then i commanded certain things all these whatever i have stated till now are not statements or propositions it is very pleasant today this statement is my opinion
71.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:57,1:25,it might not be my friends opinion and hence this is another example which is not a statement so right now we have seen certain exclamatory sentences questions commands and opinions which are not considered to be statements or propositions jk rowling is the author of harry potter series plus is equal to
71.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:25,1:46,crow is not a bird now let us just observe these sentences jk rowling is the author of harry potter series we all know that it is a true sentence plus is i am sure you must be thinking why am i even stating this or you might be even thinking that this is wrong
71.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:46,2:10,yes it is false crow is not a bird we all know that crow is a bird so these three sentences were either true or false and it is universal it is true or false for all of us so these three are examples of statements so in this video you have seen certain examples and nonexamples of statements
72.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:24,here is an important point im getting you all prepared for the kind of language and notations that well be using throughout this chapter this is one notation that you all should know so look at these two statements statement one it rained in my location today thats the first statement
72.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:24,0:47,second statement is yesterday was a full moon day now these statements can be true or false right theres no ambiguity here it rains or it doesnt rain its a full moon day or its not a full moon day at least according to the calendar you see okay so look at this statement first
72.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:47,1:10,statement p and the second statement q what if i tell you you are supposed to insert a not the word not somewhere and make this entire statement sound the other way around by that i mean if its true make it false if its false make it true how do you do that look at the first statement
73.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:41,considering that statement it rained in my location today where do we insert not as you can see this is a straightforward english question so the negation of this statement is going to be it did not rain in my location today now that is called your p compliment this is a notation for p compliment
73.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:41,1:04,so this means the statement p did not happen similarly for statement q which as i said is yesterday was a full moon day how do you write the negation of it you see the word negation could be quite new to you all that we mean by negation is that the given statement you should write the opposite of
73.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:04,1:30,it what is opposite of this by opposite i mean what is the negation of this is going to be yesterday wasnt a full moon day wasnt is actually was not a full moon day and this was your statement q and so this statement will become not q so negation is
73.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:30,2:03,a very straightforward concept given any statement lets say i will give you another statement r right now statement r is going to be my weight is less than kgs what is the negation of this not r is going to be my weight of course is not less than kgs
73.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:03,2:31,more polished way to say that is greater than or equal to you see thats the negation of less than less than doesnt not include so the negation of this that is going to be my weight is greater than or equal to kgs please take note simply putting not here will also make it not r but we are just being very
73.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:31,2:44,precise and polished and we say that my weight is greater than or equal to kgs which is the negation of my weight is less than kgs
74.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:39,here is something for us to note something thats very important look at the statement statement p i have a phd degree right what will not p be not p would be i do not have a phd degree right now concentrate let me write p and not p next to each other i am not telling you which one is
74.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:39,1:04,true whether p is true or not p is true right so when p is true which means assume sudarshan owns a phd degree then the fact that i do not have a phd this turns out to be false when p is true not p is false it sounds like im stating the obvious but yes you need to know this what is
74.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:04,1:26,called a truthtable that i am writing here when p is not p is when p is what do i mean by that i mean p is not true i have a phd is not true this is false then not p will obviously become true the fact that i dont have a phd means i do not have a phd
74.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:26,1:45,which means not p is true this is called a truthtable it simply means when p is true not p is false when p is false not p is true if you are confused dont be confused i of course am stating the obvious with a lot of examples things will be very clear to you
75.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:26,let us now see some examples where we can use negation lets see what happens when we negate a statement consider this statement p where is less than or equal to we all know that this is true and hence it gets a boolean value when we negate the statement obviously it becomes is not less than or equal to and
75.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:26,0:49,i can write it like this but its very convenient to say that is greater than this becomes the negation of the statement p well we all know that is greater than is a false statement and hence this gets a boolean value the next one plus is equal to
75.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:49,1:01,i am sure its not true the negation of this statement becomes plus is not equal to well these are all very simple examples i hope you all are catching it really fast
76.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:35,let us start with a very famous quote the quote goes like this he who knows not and knows not that he knows not hes a fool shun him he who knows not and knows that he knows not is simple teach him he who knows and knows not that he knows he is asleep wake him up
76.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:35,1:00,he who knows and knows that he knows is an intellectual hes a leader follow him do you see what just happened so let me write this thing in the form of s and s so let me write if a person is knowledgeable or not as a first thing and then is he aware
76.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:00,1:22,if hes knowledgeable or not so the first thing says he who knows not he is not knowledgeable and knows not that he knows not which means hes unaware that he is not knowledgeable thats the first one second one is he who knows not not knowledgeable and knows that he knows not
76.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:22,1:42,he is aware of the fact of his knowledge status this chap was not aware of his knowledge status whatever is his knowledge status he was unaware of what was his knowledge status but the second one is ignorant hes not knowledgeable but hes aware of the fact that he is ignorant
76.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:42,2:07,that is not knowledgeable third one he who knows a fellow who is knowledgeable and knows not that he knows he is unaware of the fact that he is knowledgeable right it says hes asleep wake him up correct makes sense the last one is he who knows and knows that he knows hes an intellectual follow him
76.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:07,2:18,look at this table the table has a these are the only possible enumerations you can think of right lets see what this has to say
77.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:24,you see all the possibilities that i just enumerated there was there that was the dangerous person its tough to handle him so i put no false meaning do not interact with him  and means he who knows not and knows not that he knows not is a fool surname
77.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:24,0:50,fool zero second one is completely harmless the simple person and he knows i am sorry its he doesnt know but he knows that he doesnt know he is simple teach him harmless person put there you can handle him third one is someone who knows but he is unaware of the fact that he knows
77.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:50,1:05,okay he is asleep wake him up again harmless and its your duty to go and wake him up he has the content but he just needs a trigger he is harmless again put a the last one is an intellectual because he knows and he knows that he knows
77.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:05,1:28,and would be a so do you see this table set of all possible truth and false assignments and some inference that we are making in the third column the third column is actually called there is a name for it i am sure most of you even know it an or operator
78.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:22,i will give a good example for this lets say you have a cultural evening at your college and you want your dad or mom one of them to be present now this is a very ambiguous statement so you go to your dad and mom and you will say dad and mom i have something to tell you
78.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:22,0:44,i have a request to raise there is a cultural evening in my college i want dad either you to come or mom you to come one of you should definitely come now analyze this statement properly what do i mean if i go to my dad and mom and i say dad you come or mom you come
78.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:44,1:03,it sounds something like you have only one entry pass and you want dad to come or mom to come this is why english is a very ambiguous language you see you might even mean definitely one of you should be there dad you have to come or mom you have to come
78.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:03,1:18,it should not so happen that both of you are missing in that case all that you are saying is i want both of you to come but its okay if one of you cannot come one of you should be there one can miss but one should be there
78.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:18,1:43,okay these are two different statements but an or operator is basically the first example i gave you which is dad mom listen to me i want dad either you to come or mom you to come i will be happy if both of you come that is precisely what is or operator
78.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:43,2:04,if both of you dont come i will be unhappy  if dad doesnt come mom comes fine i am happy satisfied right my criteria gets satisfied dad comes mom doesnt come still fine i requested one of you to come both dad and mom comes then it means i am happy
78.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:04,2:36,or is so an or operator stands for i want at least one of you to be present let me now introduce you all to what is called an or operator or or so what is it let me write all possibilities     okay or simply means one of them should be true
78.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:36,2:53,correct so or means neither of them is true so the answer is or means because one of them is indeed true correct this one is true or again is or is again
79.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:24,given the boolean variables p q and r how does the truthtable of p or q or r look like how can you even construct it you saw how to construct a truthtable for two variables it was very easy take simply two variables p and q assign p to be q to be
79.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:24,0:57,p to be q to be only four lines and you are through you would have written all possibilities but when you have three variables you got to do a little more work what is that write all possible values that p q r can take        and totally you are going to get eight lines here
79.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:57,1:20,why is that if you dont know the answer for this you probably should revise back your counting chapter right its a very obvious reason here how many possible three digit binary numbers can you think of eight to the right thats why you have eight entries okay so how do we computer p or q or r
79.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:20,1:43,the idea of or is one of them should be true so is one of them true here  none of them are true so this is going to be remember how the or table look like in two variables in three variables its going to be very similar if you spot a anywhere you must call that as true
79.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:43,2:09,so i see a here this second line so its i see a here so its everything else has a for obvious reason that you will spot somewhere so the truthtable of p or q or r will have all s except for the first entry where p q r are all s and hence the or of p q and r will be
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:04,00:00:26,the professor has introduced rule of sum and rule of product let us see more examples now alice goes to the library to read a book and the library has books of different genres alice goes to the shelf where there are seven science fictions five mystery books and two journals but alice wants to read precisely one book
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:26,00:00:58,now the question here is how many choices does alice have so you see alice wants to read precisely one book that is very important so she has seven science fictions in her choices five mystery books and two journals so among all these she can choose precisely one so the number of choices sums up to be seven plus five plus two
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:58,00:01:32,it is very obvious to see why we do a plus here because she wants to read precisely one book so alice has choices to make let us see another example in the town of germany there are eight daily newspapers and four weekly magazines printed peter wants to subscribe to exactly one newspaper and one magazine
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:01:32,00:02:00,how many choices does he have so peter wants a newspaper and a magazine i am stressing upon the word and here because he wants a newspaper and a magazine so he has eight newspapers and four magazines to choose from and therefore it is multiplied with which is choices and out of these choices he is going to pick a newspaper and a magazine
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:00,00:02:32,let me just change the question here slightly suppose peter wants a newspaper or a magazine you see the word and became or here he would have eight plus four choices which is let us move on to another example where in a society there are eight men and six women contesting in an election
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:02:32,00:03:10,how many ways can the people choose a leader out of these so there are eight men and six women so the people have plus that is ways to choose from because they wanted just one leader and hence it is a plus operation here what if the people wanted two leaders a man and a women
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:03:10,00:03:39,i hope it would be very obvious to see that it would be into which is choices if they want precisely one leader then it is choices and if they want two leaders a man and a women then it is choices let us move on to another question how many positive divisors does have
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:03:39,00:04:11,before going to the answer let me make it very clear what is a divisor a divisor is an integer which divides another number with examples it will be more clear consider the number divides divides does not divide and also divides so you see these numbers are the divisors of and is not a divisor of because it does not divide
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:04:11,00:05:03,divides hence it is a divisor of divisors are also called as factors so let us get back to the question how many positive divisors does have let me write as a product of its prime factors so is equal to into into into into into into yes so this is equal to to the into cube
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:05:03,00:05:34,so this is same as so we see that divisor of must be of the form to a into to the b now you see these a and b they must be integers where a lies between to and b lies between to so a and b lie in a particular range
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:05:34,00:05:57,now how many divisors do we get we can answer this question by checking the possibilities for a and b so you see that a has possibilities and and b has possibilities that is and supposing a takes the value so to the will be then b can take any value from to and also zero
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:05:57,00:06:53,so all these are factors of a divisor of and if b is then this becomes and a can take the values between to let me just write some divisors and so on so we have possibilities for a and possibilities for billion so how many possibilities are there for a and billion it is precisely into which is and this answers the question that there are positive divisors for
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:06:53,00:07:27,let us now see another example charlie visits an ice cream parlor to buy one and he sees that there are three types of cones four flavors of ice creams and two toppings so how many choices does charlie have to buy an ice cream let me enumerate all of them
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:07:27,00:07:46,so let this represent charlie so he wants to buy an ice cream he has three choices of cones and ill write them as c c and c so for each cone he has four choices for the ice cream flavors like this and for each flavor there can be two toppings
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:07:46,00:08:31,so this represents toppings and this represents flavors so for this cone he can choose this scoop and this topping and so on so it continues for the others as well so how many choices does charlie have he can choose between three cones four flavors and two toppings so you see he must choose one each among the three
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:08:31,00:08:59,so we have by the rule of product as into into which is choices so he has possibilities of choosing an ice cream lets move on to the question in how many ways can we draw a face card from a deck as we all know in a deck of cards there are four suits the clubs diamonds hearts and the spades
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:08:59,00:09:18,and the three face cards are j q and k so for each of them we have four like this so these are four these are four and these are four and we want to draw just one face card among all of these and so there are four plus four plus four choices which comes up to twelve
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:09:18,00:09:46,so in twelve is we can choose a face card from a deck so let me now sum up what we were discussing all these while that is the rule of sum and the rule of product rule of sum goes like this if there are n choices for one event and m choices for another
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:09:46,00:10:11,event and both cannot be done at the same time then there are n plus m choices for one event and rule of product goes like this if there are n choices of one event and m choices of another event then there are n into m choices for both these events to occur
8.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:10:11,,in the previous case when we were discussing the sum only one event can occur and hence it is a plus in the second one we want both of the events to occur and hence its the product so this goes with the rule of sum and the rule of product
80.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:21,let us now look at the and operator these are all very obvious things im sure you would have guessed what ill be saying the moment i said and here what is and the same example mom doesnt come dad doesnt come that is not their first entry mom isnt there
80.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:21,0:40,ill be unhappy okay now i have a different condition dad comes mom doesnt come i will be unhappy because i miss mom of course dad is there im happy but im not very happy so and operator means this is a different kind of a kid who expects both his parents
80.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:40,0:54,to be present dad doesnt come mom comes i am still unhappy dad comes and mom comes im extremely happy so this is called the and operator very simple
81.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:24,we saw that or truth table of pq and r how will an and truth table of three variables look like so lets fill in the table pqr to eight entries so what you mean by and all of them should be true do you think all of them are true
81.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:24,0:48,no all of them are not true so  no all of them are not true if i spot even a single i should say it is so obviously every single entry will be except for the last entry which is which will give you so p and q and r will be all s first seven entries will be and the last one will be
82.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:26,look at this long statement new delhi is the capital of india paris is the capital of france beijing is the capital of china they say berlin the capital of germany its a long sentence right is this a statement of course yes when will this statement be true and when
82.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:26,0:50,will this statement be false this is true if all the individual facts that i told you is true this entire statement big statement is false if even one of these facts are incorrect something to note this big sentence that i said that you see here is called a compound
82.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:50,1:18,statement because you see it has a lot of facts each fact is actually a statement right such statements are called compound statements and statements such as these whatever you see new delhi is the capital of india berlin is the capital of germany and so on individually are called primitive statements why primitive you cannot further break them down while
82.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:18,1:28,the big compound statement you could break them down on to primitive statements so all you need to know is what is a primitive statement and what is a compound statement
83.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:22,we have so far seen what is negation of a statement what is an or operator and what is an and operator correct we also saw that there are two different types of statements called the primitive and the compound it sounds complicated but a primitive statement simply means one piece
83.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:22,0:55,of information well a compound statement means a pieces of information stitched together with or or and correct if its still complicated you will find it very straightforward once we see this example look at this statement india is a nice place to live this is true of course right fine so people from india would definitely agree with this its not people who live outside
83.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:55,1:16,india fine so india is a nice place to live people in india are very friendly thats also known to be true so here are two statements lets say statement p india is a nice place to live statement q people are very friendly in india these two are primitive statements
83.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:16,1:40,now look at a compound statement india is a nice place to live and people here are very friendly now you see i did a p and q here this is called a compound statement i dont think we need to explain this any further just this example has made everything clear
84.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:29,nptel you have seen some simple straightforward truth tables let us now look at slightly involved truth tables so how does a truth table for not p and not q look like so what do we do p q fill up the entries of p and q and then create not p and then create not q so that it becomes easy for you to
84.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:29,0:59,create the entries for not p and not q so what is not p now p means not p will be and not q column will be simply the negation of the q column which will be and now not p and not q will be and will be and will be then again and then so
84.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:59,1:28,will be the entries of not p and not p well how does the truth table for p and q within brackets or not p look like so how do we go about constructing this table we need entries p q not p p and q and finally we need the answer p and q or not p so as you can see
84.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:28,1:52,not p will be why obvious p and q will be just verify and p and q or not p will simply be the or of the third column here and the fourth column here which would simply be let us now write the truth table for p or r
84.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:52,2:13,and q how does it look like now you have three variables which means you should first write p q r and flood the entries with all possible s and s so what do you do p will have four s four s q will have two s two s two s two s and r will have alternate and like this
84.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:13,2:37,correct this is the way in which you write all possible three digit binary numbers if you know what i mean think about it okay so what is p or r so p or r is this column or operated on this column which will be or is or is or is and so on and the rest will all be s
84.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:37,2:57,here in this column and then what will be p or r and q the final column that will be the and of the q column and this p or r column which will be because its and and
85.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:23,here is something that you all should concentrate the most important part of the chapter at the same time very confusing as well the implication p implies q what does it even mean when you have a statement p and a statement q when you say p implies q what
85.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:23,0:37,exactly does this mean you may want to unlearn what you already know about implication because we are going to finetune the meaning that you know already and give it a brand new meaning
86.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:29,one of the most important topics in this chapter is the implication p implies q so lets understand this in detail okay so please note that this is the most confused part of this chapter so we are going to go slowly and we are going to give you many examples so that things are
86.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:29,0:49,very clear to you okay the confusing part here is there are some situations in real life that appears like p implies q but it is not we will explain what we are trying to say firstly lets look at this familiar example of you know when i was a school student when
86.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:49,1:10,i was in my high school i used to attend these examinations and sometimes the questions that they would ask would be erroneous there will be a mistake in the question and the verdict the idea would be if you attempted you will get marks let us understand this carefully
86.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:10,1:30,so on this side let me write down all the possibilities of the question being right or wrong and on this side i will write down my attempt okay here is the question here is the answer now the question is wrong and my answer is wrong i will get marks
86.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:30,1:56,right so i will put here so the column q is the question type represents a wrong question represents the right question okay and a column is about my answer to the question represents wrong answer represents right answer so please note there can be a case when the question is incorrect
86.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:56,2:13,but i will assume what the question is and my answer will be right perfectly right thats also possible so lets start question is wrong answer is wrong i will get marks because you see its the mistake of the question paper setter that he gave a wrong question i am not responsible for my wrong answer
86.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:13,2:32,if the question was right i probably would have written the right answer so the benefit of doubt is always to the students as you all know so i will get my marks question is wrong my answer is right obviously the only genius students do this despite the question being wrong they might
86.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:32,2:49,imagine what should be the right version of the question and then they will write the answer no doubt this is right marks is the question is right and your answer is wrong this would be no marks right we all go and argue to the teacher that my answer is right
86.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:49,3:10,teacher will say no the question is right your answer is wrong you dont get any marks question is right answer is right very unlikely right we will writ the right answers to the right question so technically speaking this is this should fetch me marks now this is called your p implies q truthtable
86.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:10,3:34,when the question is right it implies that you will get your marks m q implies m the question is right and your answer is right you get marks right this is the typical p implies q or a implies b concept we will see more examples point to note
86.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:34,4:02,whenever you say a implies b then your table should look like this is is is is only then can you say a implies b ath column will be bth column will be and the last column will be if that be the case then you say a implies b
86.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:02,4:25,now is this i will give you an example illustration of when this is not true that will make things clear okay i am rich i may be rich i may not be rich i am happy i may be happy i may not be happy let me consider all possibilities
86.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:25,4:43,i am rich i am happy i am not rich i am not happy i am rich but not happy i am not rich but i am happy now let us look at what happens in this truthtable is it true that a person who is not rich is not happy
86.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:43,5:06,what you have to say can it so happen that a poor person not rich means what he is poor and he is not happy this is not always true you know poor people who can be happy so i will say in the last column if you are not rich you are not happy is a wrong inference
86.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:06,5:32,correct next you are not rich but you are happy this again is not true we know people who are not rich but are unhappy there are exceptions you cannot always say that not rich means happy this is not true  you are rich and you are unhappy i am sure this is mostly true but then there are people who are rich and also happy
86.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:32,5:59,even this is not true you are rich and you are happy and even this is not true okay we cannot say anything about a person being happy when he is rich so rich implies happiness is not true correct when will it be true an implication will be true if the last column turns out to be only if it not
86.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:59,6:07,that then the implication is not true as and always lets see more examples to make it clear to you
87.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:31,let us now look at another example of being hungry and eating i am not hungry i dont eat so this is perfectly acceptable right i am not hungry but i eat you see we do these all the time when we go to a restaurant on a lets say stipulated
87.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:31,0:50,time we will start eating irrespective of whether we are hungry or not we dont wait for our hunger to pitch in for us to start eating right so this is true in general when you are hungry you when you are not hungry you may end up eating perfect
87.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:50,1:16,you are hungry and you are not eating this is not possible right this is impossible zero when you are hungry you are eating now thats the way all other living beings behave except humans you see so this is perfect so what i am trying to do here we are trying to say that hungry implies eating is a valid
87.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:16,1:34,implication thats what we are trying to say here you see implication is a hard concept to understand in the first attempt the major issue here is what you think is implication and what mathematically implication is there is some sort of a difference you should grasp that difference with time
87.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:34,2:01,so that will only happen when we give you a whole lot of examples let us see another example let us now start with an example that involves some basic math let statement a be a given number ends in the last digit is statement b means statement b stands for that number is even
87.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:01,2:22,the number is even thats what b means so now lets look at all possibilities a is b is now when a is b is is this possibility is this possible thats the third column thats the third column is it possible a is means what number doesnt end in
87.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:22,2:41,b is means what number is not even yeah this is possible right this is very much possible if you take number this is the property of numbers if the number doesnt end in it is possible that the number is not even that possibility is there so i will write here
87.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:41,3:02,a b can a number not end with and still be even yes the number ending with can be even so this is possible so i put here now look at the third one this is the most important part of our discussion a number ends in a is b is that number is not even
87.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:02,3:27,is this possible no this is impossible which is okay lastly number ends in and the number is even yeah this is possible so i write here now when the last column is we say a implies b is true which means whenever a number ends in we can always say that number is even
88.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:30,let me start my explanation with a question assume there is a set a a smaller set and a bigger set b so lets say a is new york and b is the whole of the united states we know new york is in unite states now if you were born in new york it implies that you were born in us let that stay in
88.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:30,0:52,your mind as simple as it can get what we are going to say is nothing more than just this example we are going to formally see how to interpret this very fact with some rigorous mathematics whenever someone says statement p you will derive statement q didnt you derive that
88.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:52,1:17,person was born in us the moment someone said he was born in new york well if you are asked to write the truthtable of p implies q how will you write first of all not everything can be written in the form of a truthtable but p implies q being such a important logical statement it merits for one to write its truthtable
88.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:17,1:47,now please note this is the confusing most of all truthtables let us start p q p is q is  all possibilities p implies q always see this as p is a smaller set q is a bigger set like the new york and us example whenever you say p some statement is true you infer that q is also true
88.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:47,2:11,this p implies q and new york and us doesnt seem to be the same but you will soon realize they are the same lets see how when something is not in p can you conclude that something is not in q is what we are asking here do you think when p is q is stated differently all i am asking is can it so happen that inside
88.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:11,2:32,this set there is no element given an element x which probably is in the universal set forget about a and b a is a smaller set b is a bigger set containing a and there is a universal set u if i give you an element x and that element is not in a can you say that element is not
88.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:32,2:52,in b not necessarily but yes it can be true look at this statement when something is not in a it could be in b but not necessary is all i am saying now look what is the next statement an element is not in a can it be in b
88.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:52,3:14,not necessarily but yes it can be true same statement you see now what is the next statement and an element e is in a but not in b is that possible that is impossible first one is not necessarily true but yes it can be true second one is also not necessarily true but can be possible at times
88.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:14,3:37,third one is impossible fourth one is an element is in a implies the element is in b also very true this is always possible actually you see first one is not impossible second one is not possible third one is impossible and fourth one is let us put it under the not impossible category
88.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:37,4:03,correct now when it is not impossible we write when it is not impossible always possible we write when it is impossible we write this is the convention that we are using to develop the truthtable i repeat it is extremely confusing why the entries are all s here in fact i took up this exercise of going through all the videos online and in the comment
88.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:03,4:25,section of most of the youtube videos i observed that many people have this confusion that i understand when p is q is p implies q is i understand when p is and q is p implies q is but i dont understand how when p is and q is p implies q is
88.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:25,4:45,the explanation is with the subsets that i told you right now better explanation is please dont break your head it is more of a convention to call it simply because it maybe possible it is not impossible at times it is possible that p is not true but q is true
88.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:45,5:07,that is why we put there this truthtable is more of a convention the only thing that you should concentrate on is implying is never true a word of advice if you didnt understand what is p implies q stare at this truthtable many times if possible even memorize it
88.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:07,5:13,with time you will get the wisdom of what exactly one means by p implies q
89.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:36,you do encounter sentences such as these necessary and sufficient condition implies and implied by if and only if they are all perfectly sounding english statements but what exactly do they mean in fact they all mean the same and let me tell you what exactly they mean they simply mean whenever you are given two statements namely p and q if p implies q and
89.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:36,0:56,q implies p then you say p is implied and p implies and implied by q p is necessary for q p is necessary and sufficient for q and we also say p if and only if q we will see more of this very soon
9.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:05,00:00:26,our aim now would be to understand the notion of factorial of a number let us see what are factorials all about let us revisit how we started off with the chapter in how many ways can this one person take her photographs in how many ways can two people take it
9.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,00:00:26,,in how many ways can three people take it in how many ways can four and five people take it as youre observing all we are doing here is n factorial let us now see how exactly it turns out to be n factorial
90.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:21,let us look at some properties of numbers and try to see if we can understand implication properly you see whats a prime number a prime number is something that doesnt have any divisors is a prime number is a prime number you cannot find a number which divides you cannot find a number that divides
90.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:21,0:43,is a prime number right is a prime number you cannot find a number that divides so now whenever you take a number that is not prime lets say a is not prime take any nonprime number it implies that a square is also a not prime correct it goes without saying
90.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:43,1:02,when you take some number and take its square that square will always be divisible by a a square is always divisible by a and hence by the definition of prime number a square is not a prime number a is not prime implies a square is not prime let me take another example second example
90.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:02,1:23,a is an even number implies a square is an even number correct why whenever a is even a is in the form m a square will be of the form m square which obviously is an even number as you can see you have a multiple of which is always even
90.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:23,1:43,so a is even implies a square is also even now let us ask a question if you are given that a square is even does it imply that a is even a square is even indeed implies a is even why if a were to be odd square of an odd number
90.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:43,1:58,should be odd if a square is even then definitely that particular a whose square is giving you a square and hence becoming and you observe that it is even means that a is even think about it for a minute take a pen and paper and then work it out
90.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:58,2:18,a square is even implies a is even but then we saw a is even implies a square is even if some if p implies q and q implies p we say p two way implication symbol is how we write this as two way arrow p implies and is implied by q is how we say
90.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:18,2:40,by that we mean p and q are equivalent because when p is implying q and q is implying p they both are one and the same remember our subset example that we said p is a condition which implies that q is also true q is a condition which implies p is true
90.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:40,3:03,so whenever i said a is within b and they said b is also known to be within a a subset of b and b subset of a implies a is equal to b this is only obvious correct so p implies and implied by q is written with this bidirectional arrow and it simply denotes
90.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:03,3:23,the fact that p implies q is true and q implies p is true and the truthtable of this p implies and implied by q looks like this if p is q should be both are of the same parity thats what this is bidirectional thing means so it is true
90.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:23,3:44,if p is and q is that is impossible it is false if p is q is false if p is and q is it is true so this is the truthtable of p implies and implied by q you will observe that if you were to write the truthtable of p implies q and q implies p and do an and of it it will
90.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:44,3:48,resemble this and
91.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:36,we saw what is double implication right it has two parts p implies q and q implies p now given p implies q q implies p is called the converse of p implies q let me illustrate this with an example if p stands for it rained and q stands for the weather is good p implies q
91.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:36,0:55,means when it rains the weather becomes good and the converse of this is when the weather is good it implies that it has rained you obviously see that these two are different right we have seen this example already so im just trying to tell you that there is a terminology used to describe
91.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:55,1:20,this wherever p implies q is given q implies p stands for the converse of p implies q generally we use this name in the proofs of theorems involving double implications you will see that very soon in the forthcoming talks now if we are given p implies q a compound statement
91.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:20,1:47,then not p implies not q is called the inverse of p implies q more interesting is the combination of these two by that i mean not q implies not p this is called contraposition statement of p implies q what is interesting about this let us try writing the truthtable of not q implies
91.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:47,2:13,not p see the entries as you observe the truthtable of this matches with the truthtable of p implies q we will soon see what exactly this means and what is its importance for the time being just get familiar with these names namely converse inverse and contraposition
92.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:22,let us take an interesting example assume our friend john has two girlfriends and they dont know each other it is wrong to have two girlfriends i am in no way advocating this i am only giving this as a nice example because its very easy on your minds to
92.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:22,0:46,understand what im going to say next john has two girlfriends and they do not know each other now john is a very happy person if he is with his first girlfriend he is also a happy person if he is with his second girlfriend but he is obviously unhappy if he is with neither of them
92.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:46,1:13,if he is lonely at the same time you can imagine what will be his plight in case both the girlfriends meet each other and he is there in the picture simultaneously with them right its going to be a disaster so do you see the truthtable here this truthtable is a very well known boolean operator called the exclusive or
93.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:32,so what would a truthtable for xor look like so let me explain  xor means precisely one of them should be the other one should be only then its true correct so will be precisely one of them is so this is true precisely one of these two is so
93.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:32,0:55,so precisely one of them should be this is not true both of them are so i will call it this is my exclusive or and we denote it by a v with a dash in the bottom okay a nice way to understand exclusive or rather xor is with the following example also
93.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:55,1:18,i gave one example and i will give you another example to make things clear so assume you have only one pass and you want to take one of your two friends to a movie but you have only one ticket so what you say is dear ram and raj i will take one of you
93.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:18,1:32,you people decide who wants to come and then i want to accompany one of you only now i have an empty ticket if none of them come i will be unhappy i want precisely one of them to come ram doesnt come raj doesnt come i will be unhappy
93.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:32,1:48,ram comes raj doesnt come i will be happy because i have only ticket and ram joins me ram doesnt come raj comes i am happy ram comes and raj comes i am in a huge dilemma whom to take right now correct so this is called exclusive or
94.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:28,remember what is xor rather exclusive or remember its truthtable it looks like this right whenever p and q are such that one of them is one of them is only then you have a one otherwise its always now extending this to three variables xor is defined this way so p xor q xor r will simply be first compute p xor q and then for the
94.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:28,0:52,resultant you compute xor r so write down all the truthtables p q r eight lines so p xor q will be what will give me again the next line has next one has precisely and so its and then again here here because you have a and here because you have a
94.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:52,1:21,and here because you have and here because it is now what is p xor q xor r right so you take this and xor p xor q with r these two entries xor is xor is and right now you see when you have three s youre getting a when you
94.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:21,1:40,have two s youre getting a two ones you are getting when you have a single you get a two s again gives you im going from bottom to up when you have single you get a single gives you and no s gives you okay please note whenever you have a single
94.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:40,1:46,you get a when you have precisely two s you get a when you have three s you get a
95.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:24,let us write a very simple truthtable for p implies not p how does it look like p will be not p will be and then you will get p implies not p which means implies which is implies means it is false so it will be this is how the truthtable looks like
95.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:24,0:52,we need to now write the truthtable for p xor p or q okay how do we go about p will be this q will be this p or q will be simply or of this p column and q column which will give you okay and then we are xor in p the first column with p or q the third column so what is
95.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:52,1:15,exclusive or precisely one of them should be true and the other one should be as you can see xor will be xor will be xor will be see how that how xor works again xor will be so the entries will be let us write the truthtable for this weirdly looking
95.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:15,1:34,weird looking expression q and p implies an implied by q what do you mean by implies and implied by q ill explain so p entries q entries in the table first columns and then p implies and implied by q means when p is q should be and vice versa both of them should be of the same
95.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:34,1:59,value same parity to be precise right okay so this will be implies means it should be implies means as i told you they are of different parity so this will be implies will be and will yield now what should we find q and p is implied and implies q
95.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:59,2:19,so which is basically the what we should do is nd column and the rd column we should take an and and is and is and is and is im sure you all are as fast as me theres nothing much here so why are we doing all these things it sounds like waste of time no you
95.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:19,2:39,should get used to how to write truthtables i mean thats a very important skill not something that will make you become a champion in computer science or math it is just that someone who claims he knows everything about these operators should know how one writes truthtables thats it
96.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:26,let us consider a compound statement a compound statement as you all know we have been discussing can be represented as a boolean expression like this right consider these three expressions do you think one can come out with an expression that is always true do you think any of these
96.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:26,0:42,fall into that category forget about that being always true what about a compound statement that is always false which among these is a compound statement that is always false
97.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:26,let us now look at an example of a boolean expression that is a tautology so what do we do we should just observe that the entries below that expression is all s you should not even spot a single okay lets see our example is going to be p implies p or q now how do i write the truthtable of this
97.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:26,0:52,first i write down p then q and i now have p or q what is p or q correct this is how the or works now p implies p or q how does this work look at the p column look at the p or r column simply do implication of this with this
97.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:52,1:24,so implies is you remember how a implies b works implies is implies is implies is and so i get all s in this column corresponding to p implies p or q and hence this expression this truthtable this p implies p or q is a tautology which means its always true
97.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:24,1:43,so do we really need to use these truthtable to say that this is always true not really p implies p or q let me think about it when it is not a tautology when p ends up being and p or q ends up being thats the only place where an implication can go false
97.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:43,2:04,if i can show that this is impossible that p being and this being is impossible obviously it is a tautology isnt it think about it and how do i do that let me say p is then this p becomes when this p becomes irrespective of what q is p or q will be
97.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:04,2:22,so you can never have implies ever which means this implication will always be true which means it is a tautology you see the ingenuity of this argument i did not write a truthtable but still showed that every entry here will be it can never be
98.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:30,and now let us look at an example of a contradiction consider this complicated expression not of p implies q and q my question is if you write the truthtable how will the truthtable of this look like can you guess without writing the truthtable okay so lets write the truthtable right now and then let me give you a tip on how to do this
98.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:30,0:53,even without writing a truthtable so p is as and always q is what is p implies q we have seen enough of it right perfect what is not of p implies q we are basically going step by step not of p implies q will be the negation of p implies q which is becomes becomes
98.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:53,1:27,becomes and becomes here as you can see and then this column and q will simply be and is and is and is and is and hence the column corresponding to your expression not of p implies q and q happens to be all s and hence a contradiction now look at very different way of showing that such a truthtable should end up having
98.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:27,1:52,all s in this expression below this expression so how do i show that when the on contrary let me assume that this becomes how will it become let me see q has to be for this expression to be when q is this q becomes and no matter what p is or okay this implication will
98.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:52,2:18,become true and when this implication becomes true not of that becomes false so false and q whenever q becomes this expression on the left side of and forces itself to become think about it and hence this is always you can never make this become equal to it will always be equal to
98.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:18,2:26,you may want to understand this carefully by maybe watching the video once more and trying to figure it out all by yourself
99.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:02,0:23,look at this big boolean expression i have an important question about it by important i mean it is important in computer science and it is still considered a very hard question and we dont know a nice answer for it the question goes like this for this big boolean expression
99.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:23,0:45,is there an assignment is there an assignment that makes it true you might say its not a big deal what is there in it come on let us try some manipulation some assignments to the different boolean variables and then try to see if something gives me a one so you try try try
99.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:45,1:06,and you dont get after a while you discard it by saying no there is no assignment which makes it one or if some assignment makes it one you say yes this is the assignment which makes it one so the question is given a big boolean expression can you tell me if there is some assignment
99.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:06,1:14,that makes the entire boolean expression become true as in always we can try all possibilities
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:04,0:36,so i have tried all the possibilities manually for the total number of paths without crossing the diagonal from to let me show you this is one possibility this is another one this is yet another possibility and so on it might surprise you that there are such possibilities to go from to without crossing the diagonal
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:36,1:07,we saw that the answer is not necessarily choose which is all possibilities divided by it was something else so a straightforward intuition of seeing that crossing and not crossing would be of the same numbers and hence its going to be choose by may not work something to note here correct so what else will work lets see what works
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:07,1:27,here before going any further i will try recollecting a small tip that i have been giving you when it comes to counting correct when you want to count a set count the number of elements in a set what you do is you try creating a onetoone correspondence to
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:27,1:48,another set where counting is very easy and then show that this set has the same number of elements as this set and counting in this set is very easy and hence the number of elements in this set is now known right im going to use this technique right now in a very subtle way
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:48,2:16,the concept is slightly deep you may want to watch this video multiple times to understand what we are saying so now lets get started what was the question what are the total number of ways in which you can reach from without trespassing the diagonal alright let me now observe an instance where i actually trespassed the diagonal and i will count all those
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:16,2:39,possibilities which crosses the diagonal and then i will subtract that from my all possibilities which is choose and i am done correct so all that remains right now is to count the number of ways in which you can trespass the fence i will start with just one such instance look at
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:39,3:13,this ruururruru when you take a first step that is r you are well below the fence and next when you take u you touch the fence and another u you trespass the fence right and then you take a few more steps let me put a vertical line immediately after that state when you trespass the fence and
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:13,3:36,what i do is a small trick here i take the right side of this vertical line and take the compliment of it so an r becomes u and a u becomes r i will take a compliment of it like this alright why am i doing this call me crazy you will get to know why i am doing this in some time but as
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:36,3:57,of now you dont worry much about why exactly is he doing this compliment business right okay observe on the left side of the vertical line you have one u more than the r that is when you put a vertical line the rule is not just you put a vertical line after two us
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:57,4:18,it is whenever you trespass trespassing is when you have one u more than the number of rs correct there are two us here one r here that is when you trespass the diagonal when you are on the diagonal the number of rs and us is the same correct when you trespass one there is one u
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:18,4:37,more than the number of rs put a vertical line and on the right side when you have one r one u more than an r on the left side of the vertical line obviously there should be one r more than the number of us in the right side that is when you will get equal number of rs us pause the video
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:37,4:55,and think about it on the left side you have one u more than the number of rs on the right side you have one r more than a number of us always whenever you put a vertical line on the left side you will have this on the right side you will have this and what i do is i take the compliment of the
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:55,5:22,right side which had one r more than a number of us in the compliment you will get one u more than the number of rs on the left side you already had one u more than the number of rs and a net total right now will be us more than the number of rs which means you now have four rs and six us what
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:22,5:51,on earth does this denote this doesnt denote a way from to this simply denotes a combination of four rs and six us okay now what exactly happened so far i took an invalid move and i created a unique mapping to a set containing elements with four rs and us
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:51,6:11,and my claim right now is this mapping is unique unique in what sense every element on this side on which side of the left side what does that denote it denotes all possible trespassing cases on the left side and on the right side all possible four rs and six us and its
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:11,6:43,combinations how many such things are there pretty straightforward isnt it choose correct there are choose such possibilities and now what do we observe for any rs and us possibilities you can actually put a vertical line after one u more than the r possibility and then take the complement you will get a unique element in the left side and viceversa correct for an
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:43,7:03,element to the left side you have a unique element on the right side for every element in the right side you have a unique element on the left side right and hence the total number of possibilities that are trespassing are precisely choose and i want to subtract this from choose which
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:03,7:37,is total number of possibilities so my final answer of all those possibilities that doesnt trespass the line is choose minus all the invalid ones trespassing choose choose minus choose and thats going to be my answer observe we can even generalize this and we get n choose n minus n choose n minus as the answer for the question when you want to move
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:37,7:55,from to nn without trespassing the line i believe this lecture was quick it was intended to be that way i request you all to please pause here and there and watch the video multiple times so that you understand every piece of what is being told there are actually several pieces
BLG9E_PoXXc.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:55,8:11,here right theres a beautiful onetoone correspondence idea that we use to count the total number of trespassing instances and you use that to subtract from all possibilities and hence finally you will get those possibilities where you do not trespass
ITtqOY_9Ts0.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:05,0:28,we saw in this chapter seven nice ideas the first one was the notion of factorial where it appears applications its meaning and so on we solved a couple of problems on it and then we switch to permutations the notion of npr the picture example and so on and then we studied
ITtqOY_9Ts0.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:28,0:59,combinations n choose r and the relationship between permutations and combinations the fourth point was the binomial theorem which was the generalization of your simple a plus b the whole square formula the next was the generalization of binomial theorem which is the multinomial theorem and then we saw the pascals triangle and some of its very cool properties and finally we
ITtqOY_9Ts0.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:59,1:06,just saw the idea of catalan numbers and how it is useful in different walks of computing
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:04,0:27,we have discussed of what are catalan numbers let us now see some examples of catalan numbers the first one parenthesis example i hope you all know what is parenthesis these are called as parenthesis now we will be given n pair of parenthesis and we would like to form a
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:27,0:53,valid grouping of them what do i mean by valid valid grouping means for every open parenthesis there must be a closed parenthesis now this is a valid parenthesis grouping this is also valid but this is not valid because here is a open parenthesis here is another one here is
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:53,1:17,a closed one for this so this is valid but again we have an open one and hence there is no closed parenthesis for this therefore it is not valid now the question is how many groupings are there for each value of n let us check if n is zero that is we do not have any parenthesis
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:17,1:36,in how many ways can we have this just one way this might seem to be a little confusing to you i say that there are no parenthesis and then i say one way but just bear with me at this place when it is zero we say that its one way of having no parenthesis when n is one
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:36,1:59,what do i mean by one we have one open and one closed parenthesis so the only way to do this is this one and hence we have one way when n is two we have two closed and two open so the two possibilities are this is one and this is another one so we have two ways of doing this
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:59,2:25,when n is equal to three that is we have three closed and three open parenthesis so all the possibilities goes like this this is one this is one this is another one this is another one and this is the last one so we have five ways of grouping three pairs of parenthesis when n
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:25,2:50,is equal to four well this is a large number you have ways of doing this you might want to stop here and do it all by yourself so we see that the sequence is one one two five fourteen and so on so here we see that catalan numbers hold true in the case of grouping
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,2:50,3:26,of parenthesis the next one this is called polygon triangulation by triangulation we mean constructing triangles inside the polygon in a particular way let me tell you how if this is a polygon i mean constructing triangles this way we do not want to construct triangles like this we dont want two lines to cross over each other so here ill directly start from n is equal to three
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:26,3:46,n is equal to three we get a triangle itself this is just one way of getting a triangle when n is equal to four what do i mean by this i have a square and how do i triangulate it i have to construct triangles so there are two possibilities of doing it and two ways now when
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,3:46,4:07,n is equal to five that is i have a five sided polygon this one now how can i triangulate this this is one this is another one this is another one like this and this is the last one so i have exhausted all the possibilities so we have five ways of triangulating a five sided
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:07,4:32,polygon it can be done in fourteen ways for n is equal to so we get the sequence one one two five fourteen and so on so this gives the catalan numbers the next one handshakes across the table this is interesting if n people are seated around a round
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:32,4:55,table please observe i am going to take only even number of people in how many ways can they all simultaneously shake hands with another person at the table such that nobody crosses arms across each other so we dont want to cross handshake so when n is equal to one what do i mean by this
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,4:55,5:19,there is one handshake which means there are two people here and there is one so this can be done only in one way when n is equal to two i have n that is four people seated like this and they can shake their hands either like or like this so this can be done in two ways now when n is three
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:19,5:42,it means there are six people they are seated like this and now they can handshake this way or this way or this way this way or this way so there are five ways in which six people can shake their hands without crossing now when n is equal to four there are eight people it becomes
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,5:42,6:04,slightly complicated and there are fourteen ways of doing this and so on as you keep increasing you see that the number increases so we see that one one two five fourteen so this again here when n is equal to zero we have zero people and zero people can shake their hands only in one
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:04,6:27,way and hence we see the catalan numbers here the next example is binary trees do not get confused as i say binary trees by tree i mean that consider this to be a dot and there are some lines coming out of it like this i can draw some lines connected to some other dots
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:27,6:52,so this i will call it as a tree for now this is a root and it is branching out into two branches or let me say two leaves so when n is equal to zero please note here we are going to consider those dots which have two branches so when n is zero that means that there are no branches
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,6:52,7:18,there is only one node and this can be done in one way when n is one that is there is only one node which is having two branches and this also can be done in one way when n is two what does it mean that there are two nodes having two branches each so i can draw it like this and here you see
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:18,7:43,these are the two nodes and another way is like this and these are the two nodes which have two branches each so i can when n is two it can be done in two ways now when n is three what does it mean that there are three roots which have two branches each so this can be drawn in all
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,7:43,8:06,these ways so there are five ways of drawing these binary trees please note why did we use the word binary because we are here concerned only about two branches coming out so as we increase n we see that the sequence becomes one one two five fourteen etc you might want to stop the
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:06,8:29,video here and watch the binary trees again so these were some of the examples of catalan numbers well there are several many i hope it was interesting please post all your questions and queries doubts on the discussion forum we have now come to the end of the first chapter we learned several elementary
J0heuWnOKcw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,8:29,8:40,techniques on counting these are going to be the builder blocks for more advanced techniques on counting we will now continue with the next chapter which is set theory
OrY7eOnYVSs.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:03,0:46,let us take up this problem that we discussed just now of going from to as you can see there are rights im sorry rights and ups for you to reach but then let me take an example of lets say right up right up right right up right and then up up you see let me try looking at this instance by actually going
OrY7eOnYVSs.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:46,1:16,up and then seeing what exactly happens here right and an up right and an up two rights and an up and then a right and an up up you observed something very important here that you never crossed the diagonal although you touched the diagonal you never crossed it
OrY7eOnYVSs.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:16,1:42,so here goes my question in how many ways can we start from and go towards and end our journey in without trespassing the diagonal by trespassing i mean you cannot cross this fence i am putting a fence here the fence is a diagonal you can however touch the diagonal
OrY7eOnYVSs.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:42,2:02,what is the question the question is in how many ways can you reach your destination from your starting point without trespassing the fence which happens to be our diagonal so let me count the total number of ways for this now
wcbg3MudcDw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:05,0:35,so we have seen that the total number of paths without crossing the diagonal from to any nn is given by n choose n minus n choose n plus one this goes by the name the nth catalan number denoted as cn this was given by the mathematician catalan so cn is written as n choose n minus n choose n plus one
wcbg3MudcDw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,0:35,1:10,after simplification we get it as one by n plus one into n choose n so let us see how the sequence cn goes c is one c is one by two into choose which is one c is one by three into choose which is c is one by four into choose which is and c is one by five into choose which
wcbg3MudcDw.json,Discrete Mathematics by Prof Sudarshan Iyengar,NPTEL,1:10,1:28,is and so no so the catalan numbers sequence is and so on let us see some interesting examples of catalan numbers
